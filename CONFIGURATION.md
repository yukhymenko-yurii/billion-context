# billion-context Configuration Reference

[English](./CONFIGURATION.md) | [中文](./CONFIGURATION.zh-CN.md)

`billion-context` is an HTTP proxy that injects [ACP](https://github.com/ranxianglei/acp-kernel) (Active Context Pruning) context compression into LLM API streams. Every option below lives in a single JSON config file (or an equivalent environment variable / CLI flag).

---

## Config File Locations

| Scope | Path | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Config file (Linux)** | `~/.config/billion-context/billion-context.json` | XDG Base Directory — the canonical, user-editable config |
| **Config file (override)** | value of `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | relocates the whole config dir |
| **Config file (explicit)** | value of `BILI_CONFIG_FILE` | points directly at any JSON file |
| **CLI flag** | `--config <FILE>` | same as `BILI_CONFIG_FILE`; highest precedence for the file path |
| **Session data** | `~/.local/share/billion-context/sessions/` | persisted compression state, grows over time |

On first run, `billion-context` seeds an empty template (`{ "providers": {} }`) at the config path so you have something to edit. It never overwrites an existing file.

The config file is a pure override layer — every field is optional. Anything unset falls through to the built-in default.

{
  // Server
  "port": 8787,
  "host": "127.0.0.1",

  // Route two providers
  "providers": {
    "https://api.anthropic.com": {
      "models": {

## Server Settings

Top-level keys that control how the proxy listens and behaves globally.

### `port`

- **Type:** `number`
- **Default:** `8787`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** TCP port the proxy listens on. Must be an integer between 1 and 65535. Overridden by the `ACP_PORT` (or `PORT`) environment variable, or the `--port` CLI flag. An invalid value aborts startup. This is the **user zone** (`bili start`, default `8787`) — you own this port. Lane-spawned proxies (native hooks, launcher lanes) live in a separate self-managed zone (`BILI_ZONE_PORT`, default `18787`) and never touch this one (#1660).

### `host`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** `127.0.0.1`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Network interface the proxy binds to. `127.0.0.1` (default) listens only on localhost — safe for a local sidecar. Use `::` for IPv4 + IPv6 dual-stack. Use `0.0.0.0` (or a LAN IP) to expose the proxy to other machines — typically inside a container or on a trusted LAN: remote agents then point their model `baseURL` at `http://<this-host>:<port>/bili/…`, and MITM-mode `CONNECT` accepts remote clients for whitelisted model hosts only (blind tunnels stay loopback-only, and `/__bili/` management endpoints remain loopback-only). There is no authentication — ensure the surrounding network is trusted. Overridden by `ACP_HOST` / `--host`.

### `sessionHeader`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** `x-acp-session`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Name of the HTTP request header clients may send to identify a conversation. Requests carrying the same value share compression state across calls. Overridden by `ACP_SESSION_HEADER`.

### `log`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Enable per-request logging. Set `false` (or `ACP_LOG=0`) to silence the standard request log.

### `debug`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Verbose logging — equivalent to setting `ACP_DEBUG=1`. Useful for diagnosing routing or compression behaviour.

### `passthrough`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Forward every request to the upstream **without** compression, tool injection, or nudging. Equivalent to `ACP_PASSTHROUGH=1`. Handy for A/B comparison against the uncompressed baseline.

### `compactionOptIn`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** `#1392` — opt a **non-http(s) baseUrl provider** (e.g. pi-claude-bridge's literal `"claude-bridge"`) into bili's compaction-ownership consideration. The entry's KEY is the provider id — a non-URL key is routing-inert on its own (give it [`bind`](#named-provider-entries-bind) to make it a real lane), and only feeds the launcher-exported `BILI_NON_HTTP_PROVIDERS` allowlist the pi/omp plugin consults when it would otherwise veto a non-http baseUrl outright (#1383). Opt-in only widens the candidate set: compaction is still cancelled only on positive carriage evidence (the plugin stamped the session, or `/__bili/plugin/status` confirms the proxy carries it). Env equivalent: `BILI_NON_HTTP_PROVIDERS=a,b` (union with the file, deduped). Only meaningful under `bili pi` / `bili omp` launchers or a directly-installed plugin.

  ```jsonc
  {
    "providers": {
      "claude-bridge": { "compactionOptIn": true }
    }
  }
  ```

### `compat`

- **Type:** `{ roles?: Record<string, string>; dropFields?: string[]; streamErrorShape?: "protocol" | "completion" }`
- **Default:** `{}` (disabled)
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Global wire-compat role map. `roles` maps message roles to the role name your upstream accepts, e.g. `{"compat":{"roles":{"developer":"system"}}}` rewrites `developer` → `system` on the final forwarded body for upstreams that reject the `developer` role (#552, newer codex clients). Applies to `openai` chat-completions and `responses` requests; exact-match roles only, everything else in the body is untouched; re-sent compress-retry bodies carry the same rewrite. Per-provider `compat.roles` entries (see [Providers](#providers)) win per key. Default `{}` forwards bodies byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **Learn-on-failure:** with no compat configured, an upstream `400 Invalid role: …` is auto-fixed — bili rewrites the offending role to `system`, retries once, and remembers the mapping **session-scoped** (in-memory on the session; never written to config). Later requests in that session skip the 400 round-trip. The info log emitted when the fix fires carries the permanent per-provider snippet.
- **dropFields:** dot-path list of fields to delete from the final forwarded body — for strict-schema upstreams that reject a field the *client* always sends but the upstream does not accept (#1757). Paths use plain-object segments only (`reasoning.summary`); wildcards and array indices are not supported; nonexistent paths and non-object intermediates are skipped silently; string values are never inspected or altered — structural keys only, so tool arguments and message content stay byte-exact. Unlike `roles`, it applies on every wire protocol (any JSON request body). Global and per-provider lists merge **additively** (union) — a provider entry can add paths but never retract a global one. Applied after role mapping / output steering on the final outbound body (before the prompt-cache stamp), to every body the compress-retry loops re-send, and to verbatim pass-through forwards alike. A body with no matching field is forwarded byte-for-byte unchanged; when ≥1 field is actually dropped an info line logs the dropped paths. Opt-in only — no learn-on-failure in v1: `"compat":{"dropFields":["reasoning.summary"]}`.
- **streamErrorShape:** how an upstream stream failure is presented on the anthropic/openai wire once the 200 response is already committed (`"protocol"`, default, or `"completion"`). `protocol` rides the protocol-native failure channel — anthropic/responses get an `event: error` frame, openai a top-level `error` frame followed by `[DONE]` — so clients can distinguish "this turn failed" from "this turn finished" and keep their own retry logic armed (#1455: the old synthesized `end_turn`/`finish_reason` dressed a dead turn as a normal completion and silently consumed client retry budgets). `completion` restores that legacy shape (failure text inside a synthesized successful completion) for hosts whose SDK cannot surface in-band error events. Config file: `"compat":{"streamErrorShape":"completion"}`; env `BILI_STREAM_ERROR_SHAPE` wins. Only the google wire is unaffected (already native error frames); on the responses wire this knob changes the server-side exit from the synthesized item-lifecycle completion to the `event: error` frame (its in-loop exit was already native via `response.failed`).

### `proxy`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** *(none — no upstream proxy)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Upstream HTTP proxy (`http://host:port`) used for the proxy's **own** outbound connections to model providers — for hosts where a provider is only reachable through an HTTP proxy (e.g. `api.openai.com` behind the GFW; point bili at your local v2rayA/clash HTTP port).

  **Resolution order (first match wins):** per-URL `providers.<url>.proxy` → `BILI_UPSTREAM_PROXY` env var → Web UI manual proxy → this top-level `proxy` → `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` env vars → Windows system proxy → direct. Auto mode honors `NO_PROXY` and the Windows proxy bypass list for environment/system fallbacks. A value pointing back to bili's own local port is ignored or rejected to prevent a loop. On Windows, common Clash/Mihomo static system proxies are discovered automatically; the Web UI shows the effective source and any PAC URL detected in Internet Settings.

  An empty string means "explicitly direct" — override-and-disable whatever sits below it in the chain (top level: disables any environment/system proxy fallback for all providers; per provider: just that one).

  Both outbound paths are covered: `/bili/` path-mode (fetch) AND MITM CONNECT tunnels (the proxy's connection to the real upstream goes through the HTTP CONNECT proxy). The auto-updater's own egress (npm registry check + tarball download) uses the same decision for its hosts, so `bili update` and auto-update work where npm is only reachable through the proxy (#609).

  SOCKS5 is not supported: an explicit `BILI_UPSTREAM_PROXY` / config `proxy` with a `socks5`/`socks5h` scheme fails startup with an actionable error, while env/system proxies using such a scheme are ignored with a one-time log warning (traffic falls through to direct). For Clash/mihomo, use the same mixed port over `http://` (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:7890`).

  ```jsonc
  {
    // Global default: ALL providers route through this proxy
    "proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:20172",
    "providers": {
      "https://api.openai.com/v1": {
        // Per-URL overrides global (use a different proxy for this host)
        "proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:20173"
      },
      "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/anthropic": {
        // Empty string = explicitly DIRECT, overriding the global proxy
        "proxy": ""
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### `imageBilling`

- **Type:** `"auto" | "pixels" | "bytes"`
- **Default:** `"auto"`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** How inline (base64) images are charged by the preflight size gate and output clamp (#488/#496/#767/#1843). `"pixels"` parses the image header (PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF/BMP) without decoding the body and charges pixel-tile billing (OpenAI high-detail model: 512px tiles, short side scaled up to 768px, long side capped at 2048px → 765–2805 tokens per image; unparsable formats fall back to a flat 16384). `"bytes"` charges each image at `base64 length / 4` tokens — conservative, correct for byte-billing relays, but an explicit opt-in since #1843: on unknown hosts the old default mixed this ±15× estimate into every window decision and permanently blocked image-heavy sessions whose real usage fit the window (#1800 incident: 6 screenshots estimated at 278,161 vs 18,870 billed). Remote (`https://`) images always charge a flat 4096 in either mode. `"auto"` (the default) resolves to `pixels` for every host. A per-provider `providers.<url>.imageBilling` wins over this global, and the `BILI_IMAGE_BILLING` env var wins over both (live-read, no restart).

### `imageTokenCap`

- **Type:** positive integer (tokens per image)
- **Default:** *(unset — no cap)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Blanket ceiling on the per-image token estimate used by the preflight size gate, output clamp, and image-compression stats (#488/#496/#1843). Applied on top of whatever billing mode resolved — useful when a route's real encoder bills far below even the pixel prior. Precedence: `BILI_IMAGE_TOKEN_CAP` env var (live-read, no restart) > per-provider `providers.<url>.imageTokenCap` > this global. Non-numeric or non-positive values are dropped (lenient parse, same as `imageBilling`).

### `resign`

- **Type:** `object` — scheme-keyed: `Record<scheme, { enabled?, passthrough?, credentialRef? }>` where each key is a lowercase signature scheme token as it appears on the wire's `Authorization` header (built-in: `"sdk-hmac-sha256"`)
- **Default:** the built-in `"sdk-hmac-sha256"` key resolves out of the box — `enabled: true`, `passthrough: false`, `credentialRef` *(unset — account-pool discovery)*; any scheme the file does not mention keeps those defaults
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** The config-file surface of the #1884 re-sign arm (body-covering signatures; today Huawei CodeArts APIG's `SDK-HMAC-SHA256`). The arm itself is zero-config: on dsh it discovers enabled `codearts` accounts from `$DSH_HOME/jet-hub/state.json` through the credentials service and re-signs every egress body it produces, so compression works on signed upstreams out of the box — the built-in key's defaults ARE that behavior, which is why keying by scheme does not make this a Huawei-shaped field. This block is for the failure/override paths — env vars win over the file for every field:
  - `enabled: boolean` — kill switch for that scheme; `false` unloads the arm end to end (pre-fix behavior: signed bodies ride the normal rewrite path and fail upstream with 401). Env `BILI_RESIGN=0` wins.
  - `passthrough: boolean` — opt-in verbatim forwarding for THAT scheme's requests when they cannot be re-signed (no credential, or a scheme bili cannot sign, like SigV4). The default is a **local 403 refusal** with an actionable message — no silent passthrough, because forwarding byte-untouched would silently disable compression for those requests (#1886 semantics are opt-in by design). Pinning the key pins the signature: opting `"aws4-hmac-sha256"` into passthrough never opens `"sdk-hmac-sha256"`, and vice versa. Env `BILI_RESIGN_PASSTHROUGH=1` wins.
  - `credentialRef: string` — pin the dsh credentials-service ref used for re-signing instead of account-pool discovery. Env `BILI_CODEARTS_REF` wins.

  The model-level knob is deliberately NOT a field here — see the three-level note below.

  ```jsonc
  {
    "resign": {
      "sdk-hmac-sha256": { "passthrough": true },
      "aws4-hmac-sha256": { "passthrough": true }
    }
  }
  ```

- **Strict three levels (route-first):** the #1884 knobs follow the repo's standard cascade — env var > level 3 (`providers.<url>.models.<name>.benefit`) > level 2 (`providers.<url>.resign["<scheme>"]`) > level 1 (global `resign["<scheme>"]`) > built-in default — resolved AFTER routing, the same family as [`imageBilling`](#imagebilling):

  ```jsonc
  {
    "resign": {
      "sdk-hmac-sha256": { "passthrough": false }
    },
    "providers": {
      "https://codearts.example.com": {
        "resign": {
          "sdk-hmac-sha256": { "passthrough": true }
        },
        "models": {
          "glm-5.3-flash": { "benefit": true },
          "deepseek-v4.1":  { "benefit": false }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  - `models.<name>.benefit: boolean` (level 3) — whether THIS model on THIS provider bills against the CodeArts free quota (its re-signed requests carry the signed `maas_type: benefit` header). `true`/`false` are explicit — `false` opts a default-set model out; unset falls through to the built-in fallback `glm-5.3-flash, deepseek-v4.1-flash` (the dsh codearts plugin's `CODEARTS_BENEFIT_FALLBACK` mirror). Env `BILI_RESIGN_BENEFIT` (comma-separated) wins over the whole tree.
  - `providers.<url>.resign["<scheme>"]` (level 2) — `{ enabled?, passthrough?, credentialRef? }` under the same scheme key, per-field over the global block.
  - The host-side intercept (dsh native lane) runs before routing exists and always uses the global block — that's the wire-necessity trigger (signed body must tunnel or be refused), not policy. Scheme lookup itself is case-insensitive (wire tokens arrive as `SDK-HMAC-SHA256 Access=…`, keys are lowercase).

---

## Providers

The `providers` block maps **upstream URLs** to per-provider configuration. Each key is a URL prefix; each value can declare model context windows, a per-provider proxy, a compression protocol, compression overrides, an image billing mode, a per-route passthrough, and a client-side direct exemption. Non-URL **named** keys are also allowed: they are routing-inert on their own, and become real lanes via [`bind`](#named-provider-entries-bind).
```jsonc
{
  "providers": {
    "https://api.anthropic.com": {
      "models": {
        "claude-sonnet-4-5": { "context": 200000, "output": 8192 }
      },
      "proxy": "http://10.0.0.1:7890",
      "compressProtocol": "tools",
      "compress": { "maxContextLimit": "70%" }
    }
  }
}
```

### URL key matching

Keys are matched against the request's upstream URL by **longest-prefix wins**. A key matches if the request URL equals the key, or starts with `key + "/"`. This makes matching boundary-safe: a key `https://api.example.com` matches `https://api.example.com/v1/chat` but does **not** match `https://api.example.com.evil` (an attacker-controlled lookalike host).

A shallow key (`https://open.bigmodel.cn`) matches every path on that host. A deep key (`https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/anthropic`) matches only that endpoint. When two keys both match, the longest (most specific) one wins. Trailing slashes on keys are stripped automatically.

### MITM vs `/bili/` key schemes

A login client (ZCode via MITM) and an API-key client can both hit the same host (`open.bigmodel.cn`). To let their config differ, MITM traffic uses a `mitm://` scheme in the provider lookup key while `/bili/` traffic uses the real `https://`:

| Client | Lookup key example |
|---|---|
| ZCode (MITM, login) | `mitm://open.bigmodel.cn` |
| API-key client (`/bili/`) | `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/anthropic` |

So you can give ZCode its own upstream proxy without affecting API-key clients:

```jsonc
{
  "providers": {
    "mitm://open.bigmodel.cn":            { "proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:20173" },
    "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/anthropic": { "proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:20172" }
  }
}
```

The two schemes never overlap: a `mitm://` key targets only MITM (login-client) traffic of that host, a plain `https://` key only `/bili/` (API-key) traffic.

### Named provider entries (`bind`)

A key that is not a URL (e.g. `"claude-bridge"`) is a **named** entry. On its own it is routing-inert — longest-prefix match never hits it — and carries only agent-side identity such as [`compactionOptIn`](#compactionoptin). With a `bind` field it becomes a pure **alias** of another lane:

- **Type:** `string` — the http(s) base URL of the lane to alias.
- Resolution happens **purely at config-load time**: the entry's routing fields (`compress`, `models`, `proxy`, `passthrough`, `compressProtocol`, `compat`, `imageBilling`, `imageTokenCap`) are deep-merged onto the bound URL's route and apply exactly as if written under that URL key. The name itself never appears in the request path or on the wire; the proxy keeps its single URL-prefix routing.
- **Precedence (per field):** an explicit URL-key entry beats any alias field; between sources the external `ACP_PROVIDERS` file beats inline config at every level (aliases fold in source order, first-set wins). Objects merge per key; arrays/scalars are taken wholesale from the winner — no element-wise merging.
- A named key without `bind` that still carries routing fields is dead config: bili logs a startup warning naming the key and the inert fields ("add `bind`, or move these under the URL entry") instead of silently ignoring them. Invalid `bind` values (non-string, non-http(s) URL) warn and leave the entry inert; `bind` on a URL key warns and is ignored (the key is already a lane).

```jsonc
{
  "providers": {
    "claude-bridge": {
      "bind": "https://api.anthropic.com",
      "compactionOptIn": true,
      "compress": { "maxContextLimitPct": 0.75 }
    }
  }
}
```

### `models`

- **Type:** `Record<string, { context?: number; output?: number; compress?: CompressSettings; benefit?: boolean }>`
- **Default:** *(none)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Maps a model name to its context-window declaration. The LLM `/models` endpoint does **not** return context windows (verified across OpenAI, Anthropic, zhipu, comfly), so the proxy cannot discover them at runtime. `context` is the model's context window in tokens; `output` is the max output size and serves as the output-headroom fallback when a request carries no output-budget field at all (see [`outputHeadroomMaxPct`](#outputheadroommaxpct)). It also floors the #546 output-budget restore: when a client's own `max_tokens` has starved to ≤ 200 on a tool-carrying main request, the proxy restores it to the session's last healthy budget, and that restore target is floored at the model's best-known output ceiling — client-reported runtime-info > launcher channel > this declared value > models.dev registry listing (#1665/#1840). When NO source knows the model's output ceiling, the proxy logs a one-time-per-model warning: the restore then rests solely on the client's last non-starved value, which may still truncate long sessions at max-tokens.

  **Resolution order (first match wins):** (1) per-request sources — the client's `anthropic-beta` larger-context negotiation, a cooperative plugin's report, and the launcher's per-model windows; (2) this per-model `context` declaration; (3) the **warm** models.dev registry cache, when the model is listed (relay/private hosts match the bare model name against the registry's provider-prefixed entries); (4) the built-in context table. So this per-model `context` declaration **outranks the registry** — set it to the window your relay/private deployment actually serves, and it wins even when models.dev lists a different (usually larger) window for the model. `compress.modelContextLimit` remains the highest-priority source (always wins) when you want to pin the window across every route. Each model entry may also carry a per-model `compress` block (see [Compression Tuning](#compression-tuning)), and the #1884 re-sign arm's model-level knob: `benefit: true | false` — whether this model bills against the CodeArts free quota (its re-signed requests carry the signed `maas_type: benefit` header; env `BILI_RESIGN_BENEFIT` wins over the whole tree, unset falls back to the built-in `glm-5.3-flash, deepseek-v4.1-flash` set).

  The built-in context table (step 4) is static data shipped with each release and can go stale — e.g. DeepSeek's canonical request id `deepseek-flash` is not listed on models.dev under that name (its window is listed under `deepseek-v4-flash`), so only the table answered for it (#852). The log records which source won, once per model per process (`[window] ... fallback=true` means the value came from the built-in table). If the resolved window looks wrong, declare `models.<name>.context` as above — it outranks both the registry and the table — or pin `compress.modelContextLimit`; and remember the provider key must carry the traffic's scheme (`mitm://<host>` for MITM login-client traffic, `https://<host>` for `/bili/` traffic).

### `proxy`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** *(inherits top-level `proxy`)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Per-provider upstream HTTP proxy (`http://host:port`). Overrides the top-level `proxy` for this provider only. An empty string means "explicitly direct" — override the global proxy with no proxy for this one provider.

### `compressProtocol`

- **Type:** `"tools" | "marker"`
- **Default:** `"tools"`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** How compression tools are injected into the request. `"tools"` (default) injects them as native function-call tools. `"marker"` uses a text-trigger protocol instead — use this for upstreams that cannot coexist with a declared `tools` field.

### `compress`

- **Type:** `CompressSettings`
- **Default:** *(inherits global `compress`)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Per-provider compression overrides. This is **level 2 of 3** in the merge hierarchy — see [Compression Tuning](#compression-tuning).

### `compat`

- **Type:** `{ roles?: Record<string, string>; dropFields?: string[] }`
- **Default:** `{}` (disabled)
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Per-provider wire-compat overrides. `roles` maps message roles to the role name this upstream accepts, e.g. `{"developer": "system"}` for upstreams that reject the `developer` role newer codex clients send (#552). Applied to the final forwarded `openai`/`responses` body — client-sent roles and bili's own injected prompt alike — and to every body the compress-retry loops re-send. Wins per key over the global `compat` block (see [Server Settings](#server-settings)). `dropFields` deletes client-fixed fields that strict-schema upstreams reject (#1757): dot-path plain-object paths (no wildcards/indices), merged **additively** with the global list (a provider can add paths but never retract a global one); structural deletion only — string values untouched, nonexistent paths skipped, byte-for-byte forward when nothing matches. Canonical case — SenseNova's Responses gateway 400s on pi-ai's fixed `reasoning.summary: "auto"`:

  ```jsonc
  {
    "providers": {
      "https://token.sensenova.cn/v1": {
        "compat": { "dropFields": ["reasoning.summary"] }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### `passthrough`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** *(none — compression active)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Per-route override of the global [`passthrough`](#passthrough) setting. When `true`, every request matching this route is forwarded **byte-for-byte**: no kernel round-trip (no message re-serialization, no ACP render tags, no `prompt_cache_key` removal), the response is piped through untouched, and no session state is created for that route. Use this for upstreams whose anti-fraud fingerprinting rejects bili's rewritten bodies — e.g. ZCode's `405 / 3012` ("request has been blocked due to unusual activity") on the kernel-rebuilt `messages` body (#661). A `mitm://` key targets only the MITM (login-client) traffic of that host, while a plain `https://` key targets only `/bili/` (API-key) traffic — the two schemes never overlap:

  ```jsonc
  {
    "providers": {
      "mitm://zcode.z.ai": { "passthrough": true }
    }
  }
  ```

### `direct`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** *(none — the route rides bili)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Client-side routing exemption (#1622): when `true`, this upstream is never pointed through bili **on the client side**. Store-rewriting native lanes (ZCode today) skip matching provider-store entries instead of wrapping them, so traffic flows client → upstream untouched — unlike [`passthrough`](#passthrough), which still terminates at the proxy. Matched by the same longest-URL-prefix rule as every other provider field, so any lane can honor it identically. Use it for upstreams that must see the client's real origin (e.g. an account whose request signing derives from the origin) or for providers you simply don't want routed through this machine's bili:

  ```jsonc
  {
    "providers": {
      "https://api.moonshot.cn/v1": { "direct": true }
    }
  }
  ```

### `imageBilling`

- **Type:** `"auto" | "pixels" | "bytes"`
- **Default:** *(global `imageBilling`, then `"auto"`)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Per-route override of how inline images are charged by the size gate (#767/#1843). Set `"bytes"` for byte-counting relays — under byte billing, a stale over-window baseline plus large base64 screenshots fails preflight with 502 forever even though the images bill only a few thousand tokens upstream; that is exactly why `"bytes"` is now an explicit opt-in rather than the default for unknown hosts. When unset at both levels, billing resolves to `"pixels"` for every host (#1843: the pixel prior — ~1k–3k tokens per screenshot — is the right order of magnitude for all vision encoders, while the old bytes default was off by up to 15× on non-OpenAI upstreams). The `BILI_IMAGE_BILLING` env var overrides both config levels:

  ```jsonc
  {
    "providers": {
      "https://relay.example.com/v1": { "imageBilling": "bytes" }
    }
  }
  ```

### `imageTokenCap`

- **Type:** positive integer (tokens per image)
- **Default:** *(global `imageTokenCap`, then unset — no cap)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Per-route ceiling on the per-image token estimate (#1843), applied on top of whichever billing mode resolved for this route. Wins over the global `imageTokenCap`; the `BILI_IMAGE_TOKEN_CAP` env var wins over both. Non-numeric or non-positive values are dropped (lenient parse, same as `imageBilling`).

## Compression Tuning

Compression behaviour is controlled by the `compress` block, which can appear at three levels. They merge **per-field, deepest wins**: a field set at a deeper level overrides the same field higher up, but an *unset* field at a deeper level never clears a value set higher up. In other words, the child covers the parent field-by-field — it never replaces the whole object.

The three levels, from broadest to most specific:

1. **Global** — a top-level `"compress": { … }` key. Applies to every request. This is the only level where the `injectTool` / `injectNudge` toggles are honoured.
2. **Per-provider** — a `"compress": { … }` block inside a `providers[url]` entry.
3. **Per-model** — a `"compress": { … }` block inside a `providers[url].models[model]` entry.

For each request, the proxy resolves the settings by longest-URL-prefix match (to find the provider) and the request's model name (to find the model entry), then merges global → provider → model.

### CompressSettings fields

#### `modelContextLimit`

- **Type:** `number | string`
- **Default:** *(the model's native window)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** The context window size, in tokens. This is the **denominator** the engine uses for its usage ratio (`usage = tokens / modelContextLimit`) — it is **not** a truncation cap. Accepts an absolute number (`200000`) or a percent string (`"80%"` = 80% of the model's native window, resolved from the built-in table or models.dev registry). When omitted at every level, the native window is used. This is the highest-priority source for the model limit; it overrides the built-in table, the legacy per-model `context` field, and the top-level `modelContextLimit`. Note it also serves as the **hard preflight wall**: once a payload reaches this value the proxy proactively folds context before forwarding, and if folding cannot bring it under, the request fails fast instead of being sent upstream. To keep day-to-day context small while still letting large reads burst up to the native window, keep `modelContextLimit` at its native value and use `maxContextLimit` as the soft target instead (see [Soft target with elastic headroom](#soft-target-with-elastic-headroom-1122)).

#### `outputHeadroomMaxPct`

- **Type:** `number | string`
- **Default:** `0.25`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Cap on the output-headroom reservation, as a fraction of the context window: reserved amount = `min(max_tokens, pct × window)`. **Budget source:** when the request carries no output-budget field at all (`max_tokens` / `max_completion_tokens` / `max_output_tokens`) — e.g. Codex's native Responses path sends no `max_output_tokens` (#924) — the proxy falls back to the model's declared max output: the per-route `providers[url].models[model].output` configuration first, then the models.dev registry output ceiling (bundled snapshot as offline floor); if neither exists, no reservation is made. The same cap applies to the fallback value. The reservation keeps the engine's nudge/truncate bands below `window − reserved`, so long replies can't push "input + output" past the window — it applies to APIs that count output against the window (Anthropic Messages is exempt: its input limit is enforced independently of `max_tokens`, so it is excluded). Without a cap, models whose registered max output takes a large share of the window (e.g. `maxTokens` 131072 on a 262144 window) lose most of their input budget and the 75% force-compress threshold fires at about a third of the full window. The `0.25` default bounds that loss while still guaranteeing no overflow at the 95% emergency threshold for any single-turn reply up to 25% of the window; longer replies overflow once and are recovered by the next turn's overflow self-heal. Note the cap only relaxes oversized reservations: when `max_tokens` is already ≤ `pct × window`, the reservation stays the full `max_tokens` (byte-identical to the legacy behavior). Accepts a ratio (`0.25`) or percent string (`"25%"`); set `0` to disable the reservation entirely; `>= 1` restores the legacy full-capability reservation (input + a full-budget reply always fits — what strict backends like SGLang/vLLM enforce). Negative or unparseable values reject the whole `compress` block. Example: 262144-token window, `max_tokens = 131072` → default `0.25` reserves 65536 → effective window 196608 (legacy full reservation: 131072); `max_tokens = 65536` → reserves 65536 → 196608 unchanged (65536 ≤ 25% of the window). Aligned with billion-context-pi (`#207`) via #896.

#### `maxContextLimit`

- **Type:** `number | string`
- **Default:** `"75%"`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Context-usage threshold that triggers **forced compression** nudges. Once usage crosses this ratio, the engine fires a nudge that bypasses the growth-gate and cadence checks. Accepts a ratio (`0.75`) or a percent string (`"75%"`). Lower values compress earlier. Maps to the kernel field `nudge.maxContextLimitPct`.

#### `emergencyThresholdPercent`

- **Type:** `number | string`
- **Default:** `"95%"`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Context-usage threshold that triggers **emergency truncation** of large tool outputs. Accepts a ratio or a percent string. Must be greater than or equal to `maxContextLimit`. Maps to the kernel fields `nudge.emergencyThresholdPct` and `truncate.threshold`.

#### `nudgeGrowthTokens`

- **Type:** `number`
- **Default:** `50000`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Token-growth step for soft compression nudges. A nudge fires roughly every time this many tokens become compressible. Lower values produce more frequent nudges. Maps to the kernel fields `nudge.growthFloor` and `nudge.growthCap` (it flattens the engine's adaptive band to this fixed step).

#### `preserveRecentMessages`

- **Type:** `number`
- **Default:** *(kernel default, typically `5`)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Number of most-recent messages that are never offered for compression. Protects the active working set so the model retains the latest turns verbatim. Maps to the kernel field `preserveRecentMessages`.

#### `preserveRecentTokens`

- **Type:** `number`
- **Default:** *(kernel default, typically `5000`)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Token budget reserved for recent-message protection. Maps to the kernel field `preserveRecentTokens`.

#### `minCompressRangeChars`

- **Type:** `number`
- **Default:** *(kernel default, typically `5000`)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Minimum range size, in **characters** (not tokens), for a message range to be eligible for compression; smaller ranges are skipped. English/code averages ~4 chars per token, CJK ~1-2, so the same number reads ~4× more permissive for English text than a token-based mental model. Maps to the kernel field `compress.minCompressRange`.

#### `minCompressRange`

- **Type:** `number`
- **Status:** DEPRECATED (alias of `minCompressRangeChars`, kept for backward compatibility)
- **Description:** Legacy name for `minCompressRangeChars` — same kernel mapping (`compress.minCompressRange`), same unit (characters). When both keys are set at the same level the canonical name wins; across levels the deeper level wins regardless of which name it uses.

#### `tiers`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Enable multi-tier compression — tier-2 distillation of old summaries and tier-3 condensation. Set `false` to run in tier-1-only mode (every summary is a flat tier-1 summary). Maps to the kernel field `tiers.enabled`.

#### `protectedLatestTools`

- **Type:** `string[]` (tool-name patterns, e.g. `["todo_list"]`)
- **Default:** `[]` *(none — opt in per client, tool names are client-specific)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Tool-name patterns whose **latest** tool-call + paired result are never compressed (kernel `protectedLatestTools`, requires `acp-kernel` >= 0.0.80). Built for cumulative-snapshot tools — e.g. an agent's todo/task list, where every newer result supersedes the older ones: only the newest instance is the source of truth, so protecting **all** instances (via `protectedTools`) would make that tool's history grow unboundedly, while protecting the **latest** keeps the live snapshot in context and lets every superseded instance fold normally. This solves the "agent forgets its task list after compression" failure (#639). Protection is a HARD exclusion: the latest instance is unaddressable (its refs render as `BLOCKED`), so neither suggested nor explicit compress ranges can cover it; it applies identically in both compression modes and on every wire. Patterns match like kernel tool patterns (exact name or `*` glob, e.g. `"todo_list"`, `"TodoWrite"`, `"todo*"`). Whole-array replace at the deepest defined level. Example: `{ "compress": { "protectedLatestTools": ["todo_list", "TodoWrite"] } }`.

#### `protectedTools`

- **Type:** `string[]` (tool-name patterns, e.g. `["skill"]`)
- **Default:** `[]` *(none — opt in per client, tool names are client-specific)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Tool-name patterns whose tool-calls AND paired results are **never compressed — every instance, full history** (kernel `protectedTools`). Protection is a HARD exclusion: all matching refs render as `BLOCKED`, so neither suggested nor explicit compress ranges can cover any instance; it applies identically in both compression modes and on every wire. Patterns match like kernel tool patterns (exact name or `*` glob, e.g. `"skill"`, `"skill_*"`). Whole-array replace at the deepest defined level. Example: `{ "compress": { "protectedTools": ["skill"] } }`.
- **⚠ When to use which knob (read before configuring):** choose by how a tool's results relate to each other:
  - **Independent content** — each instance carries unique information no later result supersedes (opencode/pi `skill` loads, one-shot references): use `protectedTools`. Folding an old load loses its content permanently; protection keeps every load in context (#1109).
  - **Cumulative snapshots** — each newer result supersedes the older ones (a client's todo/task list): use `protectedLatestTools`. Protecting **all** instances of such a tool makes its history grow unboundedly — the exact failure #639 worked around by protecting only the latest.
  - Rule of thumb: low-frequency, high-value tools → `protectedTools`; chatty tools → never full-history protect (context grows without bound); cumulative-snapshot tools → `protectedLatestTools`.

#### `neverPreserveRecentTools`

- **Type:** `string[]` (tool-name patterns)
- **Default:** unset → kernel built-in `["decompress", "search_context", "read", "bash"]` (requires `acp-kernel` >= 0.0.92)
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Tool-name patterns EXCLUDED from the soft-protected recent zone (`preserveRecentMessages`/`preserveRecentTokens`): matching tool results inside the recent window become compressible immediately instead of aging out first. The kernel default keeps `read`/`bash` compressible because they are the largest reclaimable mass — but that same default is what makes batch-read workflows fold freshly-read files right away and descend into the fold→re-read death loop (#1198/#1277). **Recommended remedy: remove only `read`** — `{ "compress": { "neverPreserveRecentTools": ["decompress", "search_context", "bash"] } }` — so fresh read results stay in the recent zone and age out by position later (unlike `protectedLatestTools`, which would pin the newest read forever). Prefer the simpler positive form `preserveRecentTools: ["read"]` when you don't need verbatim-replace semantics — see the next section. Keep `decompress`/`search_context` in the list: re-including them pins just-restored blocks in the recent zone where they become unreclaimable — a different disease. **⚠ Empty array `[]` is VALID and excludes nothing** (max-protection escape hatch) — unlike `protectedTools`/`protectedLatestTools` an empty array is not rejected; an explicit array replaces the default verbatim, whole-array replace at the deepest defined level.

#### `preserveRecentTools`

- **Type:** `string[]` (tool-name patterns)
- **Default:** unset → no subtraction (the `neverPreserveRecentTools` ?? built-in list governs verbatim; requires `acp-kernel` >= 0.0.93)
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** The **positive-facing** counterpart of `neverPreserveRecentTools`: tool-name patterns **removed** from the effective recent-zone exclusion list. The #1198/#1277 batch-read fold→re-read remedy becomes a one-entry config — `{ "compress": { "preserveRecentTools": ["read"] } }` — that protects fresh read results without restating (or freezing a stale hand-copy of) the built-in list, and keeps following built-in evolution. Effective exclusion = `(neverPreserveRecentTools ?? built-in) minus preserveRecentTools`; composable with an explicit `neverPreserveRecentTools` (subtraction applies to the explicit list too); glob-suffix patterns subtract matching entries (`"bash*"` removes `bash`). Prefer this knob over editing the never-list unless you genuinely need verbatim-replace semantics. **⚠ Empty array `[]` is rejected** — it is a pure no-op here, so a bare `[]` is almost certainly a typo for `neverPreserveRecentTools: []` (the max-protection escape hatch). Whole-array replace at the deepest defined level, like the sibling knobs.

#### `prompts`
- **Default:** *(kernel defaults — see `acp-kernel` `defaultPrompts`)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Override the compression prompt text injected into the system prompt and nudge messages. Every field is **load-bearing**: the kernel rules were tuned over months of production use, and overriding them can degrade summary quality (lost paths / signatures / decisions → broken retrieval). Overrides only take effect when `acknowledgePromptsRisk` resolves to `true` after the three-level merge — the flag resolves independently at its own deepest defined level and gates **all** `prompts` overrides regardless of which level each piece lives at (a global-level flag activates model-level `prompts`); otherwise they are ignored and a one-time warning is logged. Non-string fields are silently dropped (a malformed partial never clobbers a good default). Useful mainly for non-English or small-model tuning — see issue #156.

#### `acknowledgePromptsRisk`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Must be `true` for `prompts` overrides to take effect. Resolves like every other field (deepest defined level wins) and gates all `prompts` overrides regardless of which level each piece lives at — it does not need to sit in the same block as the `prompts` it unlocks. Setting it acknowledges the summary-quality risk documented above.

#### `promptPack`

- **Type:** `string` (pack name, e.g. `"lean"`)
- **Default:** `default` *(unset is equivalent — identity surface, kernel defaults everywhere)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Select a named prompt pack — a curated surface preset covering tool descriptions, compress system-prompt sections, and nudge sections — resolved from the kernel's pack chain: **project** `./.billion-context/packs/<name>.json` → **user** `<configDir>/packs/<name>.json` → **builtin** (`default`, `lean`). Built-in `lean` swaps the four ACP tool descriptions for one-liners (no snippet/guideline chrome) while keeping the compression rules default. Unknown names fall back to the identity surface with a one-time warning. Same three-level merge as the other fields; pack-surface sections (tool/section overrides) apply directly, without the `acknowledgePromptsRisk` gate — that gate governs only inline `compress.prompts` rule-text overrides. Note a pack's `prompts` block is ignored by this proxy: rule-text overrides are possible only via inline `compress.prompts`. Requires `acp-kernel` >= 0.0.66.

#### `reconcile`

- **Type:** `string` — `"off"` | `"warn"` | `"repair"`
- **Default:** `"repair"`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Controls **fold-state reconciliation** (#1921): what happens when a client resends history whose *content* has drifted from what was compressed — e.g. a fork re-serialized earlier turns (#1908), a client rewriting message bytes in place, or a provider normalizing whitespace. By default message identity is a content hash, so a one-byte churn silently drops the affected messages out of every compression block and the raw originals re-enter the wire ("fold drift"). In `"repair"` mode the proxy classifies the drift per message before the fold runs: stable tool-call anchors (`tool_use_id`) and normalized-identity anchors (NFC text, CRLF/whitespace-collapsed) re-anchor compression blocks onto the new message ids, so the fold survives client-side churn byte-for-byte-equivalent to a clean resend; genuinely *edited* messages (normalized text differs, or length drifts beyond `max(256, 25%)`) are left to re-enter the wire unfolded — honest, never a silent rewrite — and the next compression pass re-folds them. `"warn"` runs the same classifier but only logs what it found; `"off"` disables the layer entirely (pre-#1921 behavior). The environment variable `BILI_FOLD_RECONCILE` overrides the configured value for one process. Anchor metadata is persisted per session (`foldAnchors` in the session record, capped at 16384 entries) and covers the messages each block actually references. A one-line `info` is logged when the system prompt changes without any message churn (system-only drift never touches fold state).

#### `absorb`

- **Type:** `object` (`{ enabled?, minToolTokens?, contextThresholdPct?, excludeTools?, toolName? }`)
- **Default:** *(disabled — the feature is off unless you set `enabled: true`)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Opt-in **instant tool-result compression** (issue #605, via the `acp-kernel` absorb API). When enabled, large tool results get a forced `[ACP absorb]` instruction at result time; the model distills the result into a compact summary via the `absorb` tool, and the original tool-call/tool-result pair is hidden from the wire from the next turn on — keeping mid-session pressure lower between fold rounds. Sub-fields (merged deepest-wins like every other CompressSettings field):
  - `enabled: boolean` — master switch; anything other than `true` keeps the feature fully off (no tool, no prompt, no markers).
  - `minToolTokens: number` — only results at or above this many tokens are prompted (kernel default 1000).
  - `contextThresholdPct: number|percent-string` — only prompt once usage reaches this fraction of `modelContextLimit` (`0` = size gate alone; `"75%"` is accepted).
  - `excludeTools: string[]` — tool-name patterns never absorbed. **Known limitation:** a no-op on tool *results* until [ranxianglei/acp-kernel#213](https://github.com/ranxianglei/acp-kernel/issues/213) ships (wire projections don't carry `toolName` on results, so the kernel's name guard can't fire).
  - `toolName: string` — rename the injected tool (default `"absorb"`); the advertised/injected schema, the system-prompt section and per-session adjudication all follow the name in both lanes. **Lane governance (#1359):** plugin mode governs the *entire* `absorb` block by the **base** config, so a renamed tool is advertised under that name and executed under it (they can never diverge); provider/model-level `absorb.*` overrides are **proxy-lane-only** (the proxy injects and adjudicates the merged name). A load-time warning lists any provider/model `absorb.*` field whose value diverges from base.
  Injection follows the wire's native-tool surface: proxy mode injects the tool (under the per-request resolved name) + a system-prompt section on the anthropic/openai/responses native-tools wires, plugin mode advertises it in the plugin manifest **only while enabled** (hosts register the manifest's tools verbatim — advertising a disabled tool breaks them, #1192; the MCP shell picks it up for free). Responses **marker/text-protocol** routes are not supported (no native tool surface — the REQUIRED absorb instruction would be unsatisfiable), and title-generation requests (`max_tokens ≤ 200`) skip injection like the compress prompt does. Absorbed pairs stay hidden across restarts (persisted in the session state).

#### `ccr`

- **Type:** `object` (`{ enabled?, minToolTokens?, excludeTools?, toolName?, maxHeadChars? }`)
- **Default:** *(on in proxy mode since v2 (#1179) — unset resolves to `enabled: true`; an explicit `enabled: false` at any level opts out. Plugin lanes stay opt-in: they arm only on an explicit global `enabled: true`, #1271/#1273.)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE (v2 — proxy mode by default; plugin mode on the anthropic + openai wires when explicitly enabled)
- **Description:** **Content-addressed message store** / built-in CCR (issue #1097/#1179, via the `acp-kernel` CCR API, acp-kernel >= 0.0.84). Instead of force-distilling oversized tool results (like `absorb`) or carrying them on the wire forever, the kernel ID-references them at arrival (the ccr-store node runs between prune and absorb within `processTurn` — ID-referencing wins over distillation): the wire keeps a deterministic, byte-stable placeholder (`📦 [acp-stored #m00423 · shell output · 4,213 tok] \`npm run build\`\n   → acp_retrieve("m00423") returns the full text`) and the original goes into the session's content store. The model retrieves the full original on demand via the injected `acp_retrieve` tool; a retrieve is ephemeral (it rides the intra-request tool-result channel, never enters fold space, consumes no message ref). Lossless by default: a retrieve not made costs one cheap tool call; a detail distilled away by absorb is gone for good. Sub-fields (merged deepest-wins like every other CompressSettings field):
   - `enabled: boolean` — master switch. **Defaults to `true`** when unset at every level (#1179); an explicit `false` at any level wins and keeps the feature fully off (no placeholders, no tool). Plugin-mode arming additionally requires an explicit global `true` (#1273) — the manifest only advertises what the operator explicitly enabled.
  - `minToolTokens: number` — only tool results at or above this many tokens are ID-referenced (kernel default `4000`); smaller results stay verbatim.
  - `excludeTools: string[]` — tool-name patterns never stored (glob suffixes allowed; kernel default: none).
  - `toolName: string` — rename the retrieval tool (default `"acp_retrieve"`); declaration, dispatch and the placeholder hint all follow the name. Must stay unique against the client's own tool names.
  - `maxHeadChars: number` — head/command preview length inside the placeholder (kernel default `96`).
  **Plugin-lane governance (#1345):** in plugin mode the whole `ccr` block follows the **base** config — sessions arm only on a base-level `enabled: true` and execute with the base `toolName` and thresholds, because the plugin manifest (the host's only declaration of the retrieve surface) is built from the base config alone. Provider/model-level `ccr.*` overrides therefore apply to proxy-mode sessions only (the proxy declares and dispatches per request under the merged block). Every divergent override is logged at config load as a `[acp-config] ccr override ignored in plugin sessions: …` warning naming the level, field, and the value plugin sessions actually use.
  The store persists as a single envelope file (`.content-store.json`) next to the session JSON, using the same at-rest codec as the session file when `BILI_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set; entries are deduped by content hash and lazily loaded per session. Only the *content* inside a `tool` result shrinks — pairing with the assistant `tool_calls` is untouched. Scope gates: **opt-in on every lane** (#1207 owner decision — `compress.ccr.enabled: true` at any level after local verification): proxy mode arms once enabled, plus plugin mode on the anthropic + openai wires where the plugin manifest advertises `acp_retrieve` while CCR is explicitly enabled globally (#1271); responses marker/text-protocol routes, `ACP_NO_INJECT_TOOL`, and the responses/google wires in plugin mode have no proven request-only round-trip channel to execute the retrieve, so the store disarms itself there instead of losing content. Since v2 (#1179), folds are lossless too: when a compress fold lands, the covered originals are persisted into the store (first-write-wins, reasoning skipped), so `acp_retrieve("mNNNNN")` works for folded content as well; `decompress` accepts optional `startId`/`endId` message refs to restore just a span of a block (ephemeral injection, same channel as retrieves); `search_context` hits carry the covered ref span (`[m00044–m00097 · N msgs]`) alongside block metadata; and `acp_status` lists the block→ref linkage (`BLOCK SPANS`) plus a separate `range-restored` count on the STORE line. Design decision (#1282): **no cap and no eviction, ever** — the envelope grows with the unique originals held and shares the session's lifecycle; the footprint is visible in `acp_status`. Per-session stats (stored bytes, current wire bytes saved, retrieve rate) surface in `acp_status`; each retrieve logs a `[ccr] retrieve …` line.

#### `search`

- **Type:** `object` (`{ planAware? }`)
- **Default:** *(off — unset resolves to `planAware: false`; the output stays byte-identical to plain lexical search)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE (CCR v3 planning-aware retrieval, #1336 — default off until measured; proxy mode + plugin mode)
- **Description:** Opt-in **planning-aware retrieval** for `search_context` (issue #1336). When enabled, if a query matches more blocks than `limit`, the candidates are re-ranked against the current plan state extracted from the in-context message view: the LAST tool call of each planning tool (built-in patterns `TodoWrite`, `todowrite`, `todo_list`, `update_plan`, `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, plus every `compress.protectedLatestTools` pattern — same latest-wins semantics as the kernel's snapshot protection) and the most recent user turn. Candidate topics/summaries are scored by weighted term overlap with that state; blocks scoring above zero sort first, ties keep the original lexical order. Two things happen only then: the returned subset can differ from the pure lexical cut, and a `[plan-aware]` steering section is appended with (a) `top fetch targets:` — the covered ref spans of the top-scoring returned blocks, and (b) a hint for any covered ref already retrieved ≥2 times this session, pointing at a one-shot `decompress({blockId, startId, endId})` range restore instead of repeat `acp_retrieve`. When the flag is off, when no plan state is in context, or when the match pool fits inside `limit`, the output is byte-identical to the pre-feature behavior. Ranking touches candidate order only — no store/fold/injection mechanics change, no new persistence, and foreign-session searches (`conversation_id`) stay read-only lexical. Every re-rank logs an `[acp-search-plan] …` line with the per-block scores. Companion stats: whole-block decompresses count up in `acp_status` under a `RETRIEVAL QUALITY` line (total, plus how many had a cheaper precise path available — i.e. the block carried a ref span and CCR was armed), so the retrieve-vs-decompress trade can be measured before/after enabling. Sub-fields (merged deepest-wins like every other CompressSettings field):
  - `planAware: boolean` — master switch; anything other than `true` keeps the feature fully off.

#### `imageCompression`

- **Type:** `object` (`{ enabled?, minTokens?, maxDimension?, quality?, format? }`)
- **Default:** *(disabled — the feature is off unless you set `enabled: true`)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE (v1 — proxy mode)
- **Description:** Opt-in **image pre-compression** for screenshot-heavy tool results (issue #1095, via the `acp-kernel` image-compression API, acp-kernel >= 0.0.84). Multimodal providers bill images by pixel area, so a phone screenshot costs more than a large code block. When enabled, screenshot-like images (deterministic heuristic classifier: portrait aspect ratio in band + minimum short side) in tool results are downscaled **once at arrival** — before they enter the wire — so the model still sees the UI at a fraction of the billed pixels. Non-screenshot images pass through byte-identical. The routing decision (pass vs downsample + recipe) is made by the kernel per image; the host executes the encode with the optional `sharp` dependency (lazy-loaded; missing or failing ⇒ the original passes through, never blocking the main flow). **Lossy by nature** — unlike text CCR, downscaled pixels can't be retrieved; mitigation: the injected `image_full` tool lets the model restore the original resolution for the rest of the session when it can't read details (sticky, idempotent; the restore persists across restarts with the shrink records). No proxy-side original storage is needed: the client's own history still carries the original bytes (it never saw the shrunk form), so a restored ref simply stops being re-routed and the original rides the wire again. Per-image savings log as `[acp-image] …` lines and aggregate into the `[acp-usage]` suffix (`img-saved=Ntok/MKB xK`). Sub-fields (merged deepest-wins like every other CompressSettings field):
  - `enabled: boolean` — master switch; anything other than `true` keeps the feature fully off (byte-identical pass-through, no `image_full` tool on the wire).
  - `minTokens: number` — only route images whose billing-aware token estimate ≥ this (kernel default `512`).
  - `maxDimension: number` — longest side (px) of the downsample recipe (kernel default `1280`).
  - `quality: number` — lossy encode quality 1–100 of the recipe (kernel default `80`).
  - `format: "webp" | "jpeg" | "png"` — encode format of the recipe (kernel default `"webp"`).
  All four wire carriers are rewritten at the forward boundary: Anthropic `image` blocks, OpenAI `image_url` parts (including single-string data-URL messages; remote URLs are never touched), Responses `input_image`, and Google `inlineData`. Determinism contract (same invariant as CCR #1097): the substituted-at-arrival bytes ARE the standing wire content — a guard refuses to re-route any payload that isn't a known original fingerprint for an already-shrunk ref, so processed messages re-entering the pass (fold re-requests) can't double-shrink and bust the prefix cache. Note the kernel's pixel-tile token estimate is coarse and capped (~2k tokens for large screenshots): a shrink may save real wire bytes while saving zero estimated tokens — both numbers appear in the log. Fingerprint bookkeeping is memory-only (not persisted): after a proxy restart, previously shrunk (non-restored) refs pass through at original resolution until the session resets — the double-shrink guard won't re-route payloads it can't verify as known originals, so savings for those refs pause rather than risk a double-shrink (a reset clears the records, so they re-shrink deterministically on the next arrival); previously restored refs stay restored. v1 scope gate: **proxy mode only** (plugin agents would need `image_full` advertised in their plugin manifest first). Requires `acp-kernel` >= 0.0.84 and the optional `sharp` package for actual shrinking (without it every image passes through unchanged).

#### `rules`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** **Persistent model reminders** (issue [ranxianglei/billion-context-pi#433](https://github.com/ranxianglei/billion-context-pi/issues/433), via the `acp-kernel` rules API), **off by default** — set `compress.rules: true` to enable it (the #1399 decision: once enabled the model has full rights over session rules and may call it unprompted, including delete/clear). When enabled, an `acp_rule` tool is injected alongside the ACP tools: calling it with a short `rule` argument records a principle-level reminder that is **hard-protected** from compression (the call + result stay in context across every fold), and omitting the argument lists the recorded rules. Passing `delete` with a rule id (e.g. `"rule3"`) removes that one rule (`Removed ruleN: <text>`); passing `clear: true` removes every rule. The two are mutually exclusive with each other and with `rule` — one operation per call — so a stale or accidentally-recorded rule can be deleted instead of hedged with a counter-rule. Guidance on *when* to record (user-emphasized lessons, behaviors the user asks to remember, major pitfalls hit) lives entirely in the tool description — nothing is added to the system prompt. Kernel limits apply (50 rules × 300 chars each); duplicate text is rejected pointing at the existing id. Injection follows the wire's native-tool surface exactly like `absorb`: proxy mode injects the tool on the anthropic/openai/responses native-tools wires, plugin mode advertises it in the plugin manifest **only while enabled** (hosts register the manifest's tools verbatim — advertising a disabled tool breaks them, #1192; execution gated per session). Recorded rules persist across restarts in the session state; removals persist the same way. Requires `acp-kernel` >= 0.0.70 (>= 0.0.84 for delete/clear). Humans get the full operation set without going through the model: pi/omp expose a native `/acp-rule` command with the same semantics as the tool — bare `/acp-rule` lists every recorded rule, `/acp-rule <text>` records one directly, `/acp-rule remove <id>` deletes one, and bare `/acp-rule clear` wipes all recorded rules (`clear <text>` records instead of wiping) (#1251; remove/clear added in #1399).

#### `reasoning`

- **Type:** `object` (`{ drop?, threshold? }`)
- **Default:** `drop: true`, `threshold: 2048` — on
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** **Compress-reasoning hygiene** (issue #651, the proxy-side twin of `billion-context-pi` #339/#348 / `opencode-acp` #377). Models that keep their `reasoning`/`thinking` traces on the wire accumulate a permanent uncompressible floor: the anchor of a fold is a `compress` call, and any reasoning messages sitting *before* that call survive every fold as part of the protected prefix — they can never be re-summarized, only stripped. In the storm sessions this floor reached ~50% of the visible context. When on, the proxy removes the reasoning run that immediately precedes a **closed** `compress` call — closed on **round evidence**: the call's tool result (`contentType: "tool-result"`, matching `toolCallId`) has arrived at a later index and at least one message exists after it. No user message is required, so long agentic sessions close rounds too [#348 twin]. Safety gates: the *in-flight* round (result missing, or result still the last message) is never touched; runs of ordinary tool calls (`read`, `bash`, …) keep their reasoning; a run is judged by its summed length so a 2×1200-char run still trips a 2048 gate; non-contiguous reasoning (text between the fragments) is left alone. Sub-fields (merged deepest-wins like every other CompressSettings field):
  - `drop: boolean` — kill-switch; `false` restores the old wire verbatim. Required per-provider for thinking models that mandate `reasoning` round-trip while the request carries `tools` — DeepSeek, GLM thinking and Qwen-QwQ return HTTP 400 when a prior `reasoning_content` is not echoed back. Since #684 this is largely automatic: `deepseek` upstreams **and requests whose body `model` id matches `/deepseek/i`** (#1027 — DeepSeek models served from non-deepseek gateways) are detected statically, on the **Anthropic wire** any request whose history carries a **signed thinking block** disables the drop per-request (#1658 — signed thinking must round-trip with its `tool_use` sibling or the upstream rejects the pair, so dropping it would orphan the pair; sessions without extended thinking are unaffected), and ANY upstream that 400s with a body mentioning `reasoning_content` still teaches the session to keep reasoning (self-healing, session-scoped; the ops log carries `[acp-loop] learned strictReasoningEcho`). The config remains the manual escape hatch for other strict-reasoning upstreams:
    ```jsonc
    "providers": { "https://api.deepseek.com": { "compress": { "reasoning": { "drop": false } } } }
    ```
  - `threshold: number` — character gate; runs **strictly greater** than this are dropped (`0` = drop any non-empty run). Invalid values fall back to the default instead of throwing.

#### `reasoningGuard`

- **Type:** `object` (`{ enabled?, maxContinue?, maxTierN?, markerText?, base?, offset?, debugLog? }`)
- **Default:** *(disabled — off unless you set `enabled: true` at some level)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Opt-in guard against gpt-5.x/gpt-6.x **"lattice" reasoning truncation** (issue #739; upstream [openai/codex#30364](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/30364)). These models intermittently stop at exactly `base*n + offset` reasoning tokens (default `518n−2` → 516, 1034, 1552, …) mid-thought, then answer from a half-finished thought. When an in-scope terminal round hits the lattice **and** carries an `encrypted_content` blob, bili buffers the response, re-sends it replaying its own reasoning plus a continue nudge (up to `maxContinue` continuation rounds), and folds everything into ONE response whose usage is the true summed total. Reasoning streams live to the client during the fold (no full buffering); only the final clean round's non-reasoning output is passed through. Applies to Responses/SSE streaming requests only (bili is SSE-only); compress-injected turns are exempt (the loop owns those). Sub-fields (merged deepest-wins like every other CompressSettings field):
  - `enabled: boolean` — master switch; anything other than `true` keeps the guard fully off. Scope is set by **where** this block sits in the three-level tree (global / provider / model) — there is no separate model list. The strict signature (exact lattice hit + `encrypted_content` + no tool calls) limits which rounds actually trigger recovery.
  - `maxContinue: number` — max continuation rounds after the initial round (default `3`).
  - `maxTierN: number` — highest lattice tier `n` allowed to continue (default `6`); `0` = unlimited. Raise for rare deep-tier truncations (e.g. an `n=11` hit observed on gpt-6-astra).
  - `markerText: string` — nudge text appended as a commentary message each continued round (default `"Continue thinking..."`).
  - `base: number` / `offset: number` — the lattice signature `tokens == base*n + offset` (defaults `518` / `-2`). Override if another model family truncates on a different lattice.
  - `debugLog: boolean` — verbose per-round logging (default `false`).
   ```jsonc
   // enable globally
   { "compress": { "reasoningGuard": { "enabled": true } } }
    // tune per provider (placement scopes it to that provider's traffic)
    { "providers": { "https://your-relay.example": { "compress": { "reasoningGuard": { "enabled": true, "maxContinue": 2 } } } } }
   ```

#### `priceProfile`

- **Type:** `object` (`{ w?, r?, q? }`, all non-negative numbers)
- **Default:** *(unset — reports then price folds from the request model's models.dev price row in absolute $/Mtok; only models the registry cannot resolve fall back to the kernel's built-in relative ratios `{ w: 1, r: 0.1, q: 4 }`)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Price profile for the **cache-economics verdicts** in the session cache report (`acp_cache` tool / `/acp-cache` command / `GET /__bili/cache-report`, #800/#1279). The per-fold P&L fields (`oneTimeCostUnits`, `perTurnSavingUnits`, `breakevenTurns`, `paidBack`) are computed from three multipliers over the input-token unit: `w` (cache-write cost), `r` (cache-read cost), `q` (output cost). Two unit conventions coexist, both printed verbatim in the report header (`FOLD ECONOMICS (N folds @ w=.. r=.. q=..)`):
  - **User config** uses **ratios normalized to the input price (p_in = 1)**: `w` = cacheWrite ÷ input, `r` = cacheRead ÷ input, `q` = output ÷ input. Sub-fields merge deepest-wins across the three levels like every other CompressSettings field (set `q` at provider level, refine one field at model level); fields left unset within a partial profile fall back to the kernel ratios `w: 1`, `r: 0.1`, `q: 4`.
  - **Registry default** (no level sets the key): derived from the request model's models.dev price row — **absolute $/Mtok**, `w = cost.input`, `r = cost.cache_read ?? 0.1 × input`, `q = cost.output ?? 1.5 × input` (convention fallbacks for rows without those fields). Direct-to-provider traffic gets that host's own listing; unknown relays get the first matching listing across hosts (with a one-time warning when listings conflict). Live registry wins when reachable, bundled snapshot is the offline floor (#282).
  User config wins wholesale — a profile set at any level is never mixed field-by-field with the registry row. The last request's effective value is stamped onto the session, so every report face prices folds with the profile that governed that session's most recent turn. **Report-only**: the profile never affects compression triggers, cadence, or any wire behavior. User-config examples (override the registry row, e.g. for relays with custom markup):
  ```jsonc
  // DeepSeek-V3 ≈ low output multiple
  { "providers": { "https://api.deepseek.com": { "compress": { "priceProfile": { "w": 1, "r": 0.1, "q": 1.5 } } } } }
  // OpenAI GPT-4o/o-series: 50% cached-read discount, flat writes, 4× output
  { "providers": { "https://api.openai.com": { "compress": { "priceProfile": { "w": 1, "r": 0.5, "q": 4 } } } } }
  // Self-hosted / free tier: everything costs zero tokens of your budget
  { "compress": { "priceProfile": { "w": 0, "r": 0, "q": 0 } } }
  ```
  Use list prices relative to the same model's normal input price; relays with custom markup should use their effective rates.

#### `outputSteering`

- **Type:** `object` (`{ enabled?, verbosityLevel?, effortRouting? }`)
- **Default:** *(disabled — off unless you set `enabled: true` at some level)*
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Opt-in **output-side compression** (issue #1093): two request-time levers that cut *output* tokens, which cost more than input and are billed the instant they stream. The decision logic (turn classification, L0–L4 directive wording, effort clamp) lives in acp-kernel and is shared with the agent side; bili only lands it on the wire, after every other body mutation:
  - **Verbosity steering** — a deterministic conciseness directive appended to the **tail** of the system prompt (never prepended — that would shift the client's prompt bytes and bust the prefix cache). Sentinel-wrapped and idempotent: retries never accumulate it and a level change replaces it in place. Note the wording is byte-stable across releases (a kernel wording edit is a prefix-cache bust for every session at that level).
  - **Effort routing** — classify the last user turn structurally (block composition only, no content pattern-matching); on a *mechanical continuation* (clean tool result, no error, no fresh user signal) an already-present effort field is clamped toward its minimum. Clamp-only: never injects a field the client did not send (models without effort support 400 on it), never toggles `thinking.type`, never raises `minimal`. Wires: OpenAI `reasoning_effort`, Responses `reasoning.effort`, Anthropic `thinking.budget_tokens` (floor 1024), Gemini `generationConfig.thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget` (floor 128; `-1` dynamic untouched).
  - Sub-fields (merged deepest-wins like every other CompressSettings field): `enabled: boolean` master switch; `verbosityLevel: number` 0–4 (0 = no directive, default 2); `effortRouting: boolean` (default on whenever `enabled` is). Out-of-range values fall back to defaults **with a warning** instead of rejecting the block. Applies to all four wires (openai chat / responses / anthropic / google); requests with no system carrier are left untouched (skip-if-absent).
  ```jsonc
  // enable globally
  { "compress": { "outputSteering": { "enabled": true } } }
  // only lower effort, no wording directive
  { "compress": { "outputSteering": { "enabled": true, "verbosityLevel": 0 } } }
  // per provider (placement scopes it to that provider's traffic)
  { "providers": { "https://your-relay.example": { "compress": { "outputSteering": { "enabled": true, "verbosityLevel": 3 } } } } }
  ```

#### `stripImages`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Opt-in removal of historical image payloads. When `true`, every message **except** the most recent `stripImagesKeepRecent` has its image parts dropped before the wire rebuild; an image-only message collapses to a single `[image]` text placeholder (mixed text+image messages keep their text). Recent-N images are forwarded verbatim, and a freshly-sent image always falls inside that window on the turn it arrives. Off by default — while off, the #488 image-token floor and its overflow `502` stay the opt-in signal for image-heavy payloads. Applies to both compression modes (in plugin mode the agent's own history is untouched; only the upstream-bound wire is slimmed). See issue #617.

#### `stripImagesKeepRecent`

- **Type:** `number`
- **Default:** `5`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** With `stripImages: true`, how many trailing messages keep their images verbatim. Ignored unless `stripImages` is enabled.

#### `visibilityMarkers`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Controls the 📦/❌ ACP visibility markers emitted after the proxy executes a proxy tool call (`compress` / `decompress` / `search_context` / `acp_status`). When on, each execution appends a marker line to the response stream and/or re-injects a marker message into that round's rebuilt history so the model can see what happened on later turns. Set `false` to suppress both artifacts — for deployments where models imitate or narrate around the markers (outputting their own confirmation lines or commentary; see issue #862). The tool executions themselves are unaffected: calls still run, and paired tool-call/tool-result messages are still recorded as usual; only the marker line/message is omitted. Since #913, `false` also drops the #862 silence clause from the marker-integrity note appended to nudges and the injected compress prompt — an invisible deployment has no marker for the model to imitate or narrate around, so the clause is pure noise there. The #717 anti-forgery segment stays unconditional in every configuration. Same three-level merge as every other field. The #717 anti-forgery stripping of model-emitted fake markers is independent of this flag and stays active.

### Injection toggles (global only)

These two toggles are honoured only at the **global** level. Setting them inside a per-provider or per-model `compress` block has no effect.

#### `injectTool`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Inject the `compress` / `decompress` / `search_context` tools and the compression system prompt into each request. Set `false` (or `ACP_COMPRESS_TOOL=0`) to disable tool injection entirely.

#### `injectNudge`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Description:** Inject automatic compression-nudge messages when usage thresholds are crossed. Set `false` (or `ACP_COMPRESS_NUDGE=0`) to disable nudge injection. Disabling both `injectTool` and `injectNudge` is functionally similar to `passthrough`, except the proxy still tracks token usage.

### Soft target with elastic headroom (#1122)

Autonomous agents often want two things at once: keep the *active* context small (cost/latency), while allowing a single task to burst well past that target when it genuinely needs to (e.g., reading a large file). Setting `modelContextLimit` below the model's native window cannot express that — one field plays two roles at once (the usage-ratio denominator **and** the hard preflight wall), so any payload above it gets folded mid-task or fails fast (#1122).

Express it with the existing soft bands instead: keep the limit at the native window, pin the target with `maxContextLimit`:

```jsonc
// model with a 200k native window; keep ~70k active, allow bursts up to the real edge
{
  "compress": {
    "modelContextLimit": 200000,   // = native window → hard wall only at the true edge
    "maxContextLimit": "35%"       // forced-nudge zone starts ≈ 70k (= target ÷ native window)
  }
}
```

How compression actually decides (acp-kernel, verified):

1. **Growth layer (day-to-day driver, absolute tokens):** a proactive nudge fires once cumulative growth since the last anchor (session start / last nudge / post-compression reset) reaches the growth floor **and** enough compressible mass has accumulated. Both numbers are absolute and window-independent by design: adaptive step = `clamp(round(window × 5%), 20k, 50k)` → 20k on windows ≤ ~400k, capped at 50k on ≥1M windows; growth floor ≈ 20k (22.5k on ≥1M). This layer keeps compressing long sessions even far below any percentage band.
2. **Pressure layer (percent of the window):** `usage ≥ maxContextLimit` (default 75%) → a nudge is injected every turn until context drops back under; `usage ≥ emergencyThresholdPercent` (default 95%) → forced nudge + emergency truncation.
3. **Qualification layer (kernel default 45%, not exposed):** gates only the turn-1 cold-start ticket and the block-count floor for T2/T3 tier escalation — not part of the day-to-day path.

Note: setting `maxContextLimit` below the kernel's 45% default works correctly (the layers are independent), but acp-kernel logs a per-turn validation warning (`minContextLimitPct must not exceed maxContextLimitPct`) — log noise only, thresholds are unaffected.

Behavior vs an old low-limit config (e.g., `modelContextLimit: 70000`): the hard wall moves from 70k to the native window (large reads stop being crushed mid-task or failing fast); the forced zone moves from 75%×70k ≈ 52.5k to your chosen %×native; below the forced zone the context drifts per the growth layer instead of being pinned every turn — that drift is the price of elasticity. If you need a strict daily ceiling *and* burst headroom simultaneously, static percentage bands cannot express both; choose the % for the ceiling you accept, or track structure-aware compression (#344).

The same fields work per-provider / per-model (three-level merge), and hot-reload via the web UI.

### Three-level merge example

This example shows global defaults, a per-provider override, and a per-model override all stacking per-field:

```jsonc
{
  // Level 1 — global: applies to every request
  "compress": {
    "maxContextLimit": "75%",
    "emergencyThresholdPercent": "95%",
    "nudgeGrowthTokens": 50000,
    "tiers": true,
    "injectTool": true,
    "injectNudge": true
  },

  "providers": {
    "https://api.anthropic.com": {
      // Level 2 — per-provider: overrides global fields for this provider
      "compress": {
        "maxContextLimit": "70%",          // compress a bit earlier here
        "preserveRecentMessages": 8        // keep more recent turns
      },
      "models": {
        "claude-sonnet-4-5": {
          "context": 200000,
          // Level 3 — per-model: the deepest, highest priority
          "compress": {
            "modelContextLimit": 180000,   // treat window as 180k (leaves headroom)
            "emergencyThresholdPercent": "90%"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For a request to `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` with model `claude-sonnet-4-5`, the resolved settings are:

| Field | Resolved from | Value |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| `maxContextLimit` | provider (level 2) | `"70%"` |
| `emergencyThresholdPercent` | model (level 3) | `"90%"` |
| `nudgeGrowthTokens` | global (level 1) | `50000` |
| `preserveRecentMessages` | provider (level 2) | `8` |
| `modelContextLimit` | model (level 3) | `180000` |
| `tiers` | global (level 1) | `true` |

---

## Environment Variables

Environment variables take precedence over the config file. They are useful for environment-specific overrides (CI, containers) without editing the file.

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `ACP_DEBUG` | Set to `1` for verbose logging (same as `"debug": true`). |
| `ACP_PASSTHROUGH` | Set to `1` to forward without compression (same as `"passthrough": true`). |
| `ACP_COMPRESS_TOOL` | Set to `0` to disable tool injection (same as `"compress.injectTool": false`). |
| `ACP_COMPRESS_NUDGE` | Set to `0` to disable nudge injection (same as `"compress.injectNudge": false`). |
| `ACP_MODEL_CONTEXT_LIMIT` | Override the context limit globally (absolute token count). |
| `BILLION_CONTEXT_NODE` | Explicit path to the Node executable used when a non-Node host process spawns the proxy (#819/#1429). Resolution order inside a host that is not itself Node: this override → PATH search plus well-known install locations a GUI PATH omits (`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, Volta, …) → the Electron host's own binary run as plain Node (`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`, last resort — desktop apps like deepseek-harness desktop therefore work with zero configuration). Set it to force a specific Node (e.g. newer than the host's bundled runtime); it always beats the fallbacks. |
| `BILI_CCR_RETRIEVAL_TTL_MS` | Expiry (ms) for a queued-but-undelivered `acp_retrieve` injection (#1343): if the full text stays queued this long without ever riding an upstream request, it is dropped **loudly** — warn log with refs + reason, `stats.retrieveDropped` bump, and a corrective note on the next request telling the model to re-issue `acp_retrieve`. Default `600000` (10 min); `0` disables expiry. Plugin-lane queue items only; range-restore riders (#1207) are exempt. |
| `BILI_IMAGE_TOKEN_CAP` | Cap the per-image token estimate used by the preflight size gate, output clamp, and image-compression stats (#488/#496/#1843). Applied on top of whatever billing mode resolved — a blanket ceiling for routes whose real encoder bills below even the pixel prior. Wins over both config levels ([`imageTokenCap`](#imagetokencap)); live-read per request (no restart). Unset = fall back to config (`providers.<url>.imageTokenCap`, then global), default no cap. |
| `BILI_IMAGE_BILLING` | Override the image billing mode used by the preflight size gate and output clamp (#767/#1843): `pixels` or `bytes`. Live-read per request (no restart); beats the global `imageBilling` and every per-provider `providers.<url>.imageBilling`. Since #1843 the default resolves to `pixels` for every host, so use `bytes` to force conservative byte billing process-wide (e.g. a byte-counting relay) — the per-route setting remains the narrower tool. See [`imageBilling`](#imagebilling). |
| `BILI_PREFLIGHT_HOLD_MS` | Grace period (ms) before a long preflight compression starts holding the client with keep-alive bytes (default `30000`; see #568). |
| `BILI_STREAM_KEEPALIVE_MS` | Streaming-phase client hold (#1647): when an SSE response has written zero bytes to the client for this many milliseconds, bili emits one SSE comment line (`: bili-keepalive`, a spec-level no-op) so the client's undici `bodyTimeout` (default 300s; Node built-in fetch cannot override it per request) cannot kill long prefills whose upstream pings the rewriter/strip pipes swallow. Default `15000`; `0` disables. Sibling of `BILI_PREFLIGHT_HOLD_MS`, which covers compression-preflight silence — this covers upstream-caused silence during streaming. |
| `BILI_RECLAIM_FETCH_PATCH` | Set to `0` to disable the native-mode fetch self-heal re-arm (#1158). By default the native fetch intercept installs `globalThis.fetch` as a guarded accessor, so a third-party patch that re-installs `globalThis.fetch` (e.g. dsh-http-proxy's settings refresh writing its frozen pre-bili `originalFetch`) is re-chained as the downstream and model traffic keeps routing through bili. With `0` the classic direct install stays: a third-party re-arm then wins and bili stops seeing model traffic for the session. **Egress note:** while the guard holds, claimed model traffic is dispatched by the bili proxy itself — it no longer rides the third-party chain's egress (e.g. a SOCKS5 proxy configured in dsh-http-proxy; bili's own upstream proxying supports HTTP proxies only). If you need the third-party egress back, set `0` and configure the egress at bili's level (`"proxy": "http://…"`). |
| `BILI_RESIGN` | Set to `0` to un-deploy the #1884 re-sign arm end to end (pre-fix behavior: signed bodies ride the normal rewrite path and fail upstream with 401). Default: armed — a signed model request that can be re-signed (SDK-HMAC-SHA256 with a resolvable credential) tunnels with every egress body re-signed; the arm needs no configuration on dsh (account-pool discovery via the credentials service). A signed request that CANNOT be re-signed (no credential, or an unsupported scheme like SigV4) is refused locally with 403 and an actionable message — no silent passthrough: forwarding byte-untouched would silently disable compression. Opt in to verbatim no-compression forwarding with `BILI_RESIGN_PASSTHROUGH=1` (#1886 semantics). `enabled` / `passthrough` / `credentialRef` have config-file twins under the [`resign`](#resign) block, keyed by signature scheme (`resign["sdk-hmac-sha256"]`; `providers.<url>.resign["<scheme>"]` is the level-2 override) — env vars win over the file. Scheme keys pin the passthrough opt-in: only the scheme whose key sets it tunnels.

| `BILI_CONFIG_FILE` | Override the config file path (point at any JSON file). |
| `ACP_PORT` / `PORT` | Override the listen port. |
| `ACP_HOST` | Override the listen host. |
| `ACP_UPSTREAM` | Override the default upstream base URL. |
| `ACP_LOG` | Set to `0` to disable request logging. |
| `ACP_AUTO_UPDATE` | Set to `0` to disable auto-update checks. |
| `ACP_UPDATE_TAG` | Dist-tag channel the auto-updater follows (default `latest`, e.g. `dev`). File-config key: `updateTag`. The rolling `pr` tag tracks the newest PR test build across all PRs; legacy per-PR `pr-N` tags are frozen at that PR's last build and are only followed when explicitly configured. |
| `BILI_UPDATE_REGISTRY` | Base URL override for the npm registry used by the auto-updater and `bili update` (default `https://registry.npmjs.org`). Intended for hermetic testing against a loopback registry (the verdaccio instance in the `ACP_TEST_REGISTRY` e2e suite); leave unset in production (#1153). |
| `BILI_UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` | Auto-update check period in milliseconds (default `180000`, i.e. 3 minutes; values ≤ 0 are ignored and the default applies). Shortened by the hermetic e2e suite so it never waits a full cycle (#1153). |
| `BILI_MODEL_INFO_RETRY_MS` | Cooldown (ms) before the dsh native plugin re-resolves the current model's context window after a resolve that failed or returned no window (#1812/#1836): a cached entry without a window is not final — instead of latching headerless for the process lifetime, the next request after this cooldown triggers a retry. Default `30000`; non-numeric or negative values fall back to `30000`. Test hook — shortened by the dsh-native unit test so it never waits wall-clock; leave unset in production. |
| `BILI_ADVISORY_CHECK` | Set to `0` to disable the critical-defect advisory watcher (#1481). Default ON — it runs independently of `ACP_AUTO_UPDATE` so that installs with auto-update off still get force-updated out of a known-broken version range. Fail-open: an unreachable/malformed source only warns, never blocks model traffic. File-config key: `advisoryCheck`. |
| `BILI_ADVISORY_URL` | Override for the advisory document URL. Default: the companion package `billion-context-advisories` on the configured registry (`BILI_UPDATE_REGISTRY` aware). File-config key: `advisoryUrl`. |
| `BILI_RELEASE_NOTES_CHECK` | Set to `0` to disable the tiered release-notes visibility watcher (#1870). Default ON — pure visibility: fetches the companion release-notes doc and surfaces "update ready — restart to finish" (disk newer than running) or "recommended update available" on `acp_status` and the `/acp` panel. Never installs, never restarts; fail-open. File-config key: `releaseNotesCheck`. |
| `BILI_RELEASE_NOTES_URL` | Override for the release-notes document URL. Default: the companion package `billion-context-release-notes` on the configured registry (`BILI_UPDATE_REGISTRY` aware). File-config key: `releaseNotesUrl`. |
| ~~`BILI_HOST_USAGE_CREDIT`~~ / ~~`hostUsageCredit`~~ | **Removed in #660.** Used to select the host-facing usage mode. The #408 uncompressed-baseline backfill is gone entirely — every host now reports the actually-forwarded (post-fold) request as provider-measured (matches `[acp-usage] input=`). Old values left in env or the config file are ignored; remove them. See the "Bug history lesson" section of PR #691. |
| `ACP_PROVIDERS` | Path to an external `providers.json` (legacy / shared file). |
| `BILI_REPLAY_RETRY_BASE_MS` | Base backoff delay (ms) for replay retries after a transient upstream rejection (default `1500`; set `0` to disable the delay). See #189. Also drives the main-path transport-retry backoff (#1688). |
| `BILI_REPLAY_RETRY_MAX` | Total attempts for replay retries (default `3`; set `1` to disable retries entirely — legacy single-attempt behavior). See #189. On the acp-loop/preflight/compress loops it applies to both transient HTTP failures and #1263 fail-fast network failures (pre-response reset/refused — proxy-recycle class), never to timeout/abort kinds. On the main model-request path (#1688) only fail-fast pre-response network failures are replayed; HTTP verdicts (4xx/5xx) always pass through verbatim, untried again. |
| `BILI_PROXY_KEEPALIVE_MAX_MS` | Keep-alive reuse ceiling (ms) for connections through an upstream proxy (default `55000`). Common proxies recycle idle tunnels on a ~60s cadade; capping our reuse window below that trades a few reconnects for the classic "first request after idle dies with ECONNRESET" failure (#1263). `0` = uncapped (undici defaults). Direct (non-proxied) connections are unaffected. |
| `BILI_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_MS` | Idle budget (ms) for upstream requests: time-to-first-byte and time between body chunks (default `720000` = 12 min). A healthy stream that keeps producing chunks is never cut mid-flight; a silent one is. The same value drives the underlying HTTP client's transport timeouts, so this single knob bounds long local-model prefills end-to-end (#551). |
| ~~`BILI_STREAM_STALL_MS`~~ | **Removed in #1714** (the #1452 opt-in streaming-phase stall guard is retired). In #1706 a stale `400` export turned every thinking-phase silence into a false truncation; local-model deployments legitimately go silent for minutes mid-stream (thinking phases, long prefills), so no finite sub-budget was safe for everyone. Upstream silence — prefill and mid-stream alike — is now bounded solely by the always-on `BILI_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_MS` idle budget (default 12 min, tunable). Old values are ignored; bili names a stale export once at startup (`no longer read`) — remove it from your shell profile. |
| `BILI_KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT_MS` | Keep-alive timeout (ms) for client-facing sockets (default `5000`, matching Node's implicit default; #1452). Idle client connections are reaped with a clean FIN by Node's built-in reaper; this makes the previously implicit value explicit and configurable, and the reap is classified as `reason=idle-timeout` in the connection lifecycle ledger (debug log). Non-numeric or non-positive values fall back to `5000`. |
| `BILI_EXPOSURE_LOG_INTERVAL_MS` | Interval (ms) for the periodic long-lived-exposure telemetry line `[exposure] uptime=… liveConns=… tcpHandles=… handles=… sessions=… blindTunnels=… inFlight=…` (default `3600000` = hourly; #1452). `0` disables. Exists so socket-handle leaks and zombie connections surface in long-running logs instead of post-mortem forensics. |
| `BILI_CLIENT_ERROR_BACKSTOP_MS` | Terminal backstop (ms) for the clientError drain path (#1529, follow-up to #1452 item 1): after the 300ms drain bail has `end()`ed a connection whose peer never sends FIN, the socket would otherwise sit half-open on our side indefinitely — the keep-alive reaper keys off completed responses and Node enables no SO_KEEPALIVE by default. After this much post-bail silence the proxy destroys the socket instead, classified as `reason=clienterror-backstop` in the connection lifecycle ledger with its own warn marker. Safe against the #1452 RST signature: the socket has been `resume()`-drained for the whole window, so the destroy carries no unread residual bytes. Default `30000`; `0` restores the hold-until-peer-death status quo. Non-numeric or negative values fall back to `30000`. |
| `ACP_SESSION_HEADER` | Conversation-id header name (default `x-acp-session`). |
| `ACP_REASONING_KEEP` | Responses API only: set `none` to drop all reasoning items. Default routes reasoning through the compression pipeline so it is hidden automatically once its turn is summarized (prevents the unbounded accumulation that broke Codex's prompt-cache prefix). |
| `ACP_RENDER_NONE` | Set to `1` to stop injecting per-message render tags (the `` `<acp>` `` markers carrying `mNNNNN` refs) into outgoing request history — applies to every wire format (OpenAI chat, Anthropic, Responses) and compact rebuilds (#933). Default is `text-only`: the model reads these refs to cite messages in `compress` calls, so only disable them once you've confirmed your workflow doesn't need ref-based compression (e.g. tag echoes leaking into client-visible output). Previously this variable was honored only on the Responses path and compact; #933 extended it to all paths. |
| `ACP_LOG_FILE` | Log file path (default XDG state path; `off` disables the file, keeps stderr). Auto-rotates at 10 MB. |
| `ACP_DUMP_SSE` | Directory to dump raw SSE frames for debugging — including loop-originated upstream responses (compress re-requests and truncation retries, named `<ts>-<sid>-loop<N>-raw.sse`), which the outer forward tee cannot see (#1455). |
| `BILI_STREAM_ERROR_SHAPE` | Set `"completion"` to restore the legacy failure shape on the anthropic/openai wire (failure text inside a synthesized successful completion); default `"protocol"` = protocol-native error frames (#1455). Same knob as `compat.streamErrorShape`; this env var wins. |
| `BILI_LOG_MASK_HOSTS` | Set `0` to turn OFF host masking in proxy logs (#897): non-public target hosts (private relays, internal domains) are logged verbatim instead of `<private-host>`. Default is ON (#255 — logs get pasted into public issues); credential-header masking is independent and always on. Real target hosts are always available without touching this flag: `GET /__bili/stats` → `blindTunnels`, `GET /__bili/health` (both loopback-only), and the `acp_status` output. |
| `BILI_SUBAGENT_SPLIT` | Set `0` to turn OFF Claude Code subagent session splitting (#970): by default, anthropic-wire requests carrying the `x-claude-code-agent-id` + `x-claude-code-parent-agent-id` pair (background subagents) get their own `<session>\|sub:<agent-id>` session — own lock chain and compression state — instead of queueing behind the main session's lock. Default is ON. `"subagentSplit": false` in the config file does the same; the env var wins. |
| `BILI_FORK_ADOPTION` | Set `1` to turn ON fork block-adoption (#629): when an anonymous (prefix-affinity) client forks its history mid-conversation (edit-and-resend / regenerate an earlier turn), the new session inherits the parent's compression blocks whose source content is fully present in the forked request — instead of restarting with zero compression state and re-folding the shared prefix from scratch. Default is OFF. Identified resume-forks are NOT governed by this switch — they adopt blocks together with `BILI_RESUME_INHERITANCE` (#1834). `"forkAdoption": true` in the config file does the same; the env var wins. The adoptable inventory is logged on every anonymous fork even while disabled, so you can size the win before flipping it on. |
| `BILI_RESUME_INHERITANCE` | Set `0` to turn OFF resume inheritance (ON by default) (#1486): when an identified client (sends its own session id, e.g. Claude Code's `x-claude-code-session-id`) resumes a conversation under a NEW session id while replaying the full transcript (`cc --resume` forks a fresh UUID), bili matches the incoming history byte-exactly against that client's tracked chains (≥8 messages, append-only tracking) and, on the resumed session's first request, inherits the parent's ref assignments — stale model citations then resolve to their ORIGINAL messages instead of mis-hitting renumbered ones — adopts the fully-present compression blocks (together with this inheritance, #1834: losing them on resume meant the folded originals came back on the wire and the upstream request ballooned; the old `forkAdoption` co-gate now applies only to anonymous forks, #629), and records the `derivedFrom` lineage. The parent is never modified and fresh messages number above the parent's ref space. A resume must strictly EXTEND the parent's history — an equal-depth byte-exact replay under another id is a duplicate, not a resume. Anonymous sessions are unaffected (they keep their own pfa-* world, #309). `"resumeInheritance": false` in the config file does the same; the env var wins. |
| `BILI_STABLE_SYSTEM_ANCHOR` | Set `1` to enable stable-system anchoring (#1085) — a **best-effort wire-layer fallback** for prefix caching: the root fix belongs client-side (the client owns its history and decides how to present instruction changes), this only stops the proxy from letting a changed head invalidate the whole cached prefix. **Plain-proxy mode only**: plugin-mode agents (`x-bili-plugin`) own their context management and are never anchored, so clients that already inject cache-friendly updates (e.g. claude-code-style system reminders) are not double-processed. When enabled, bili remembers each session's first-seen head system/instructions block and keeps re-sending those exact bytes even when the client's system prompt later changes. A **localized** change (a file-style edit sharing ≥70% of lines with the version in effect so far) appends a trailing `[System context update] …` user note carrying a compact line diff (`-` removed / `+` added; each note composes sequentially onto the previous one). A **non-localized** change (structural reshuffle, tool-def churn, timestamped banners, heads over 400 lines) is adopted outright — one deliberate cache miss beats appending noise that would mislead the model about its instructions. Churn guard: more than 8 accumulated notes likewise replace the anchor with the newest text and clear the log. The anchor and note log persist with the session and survive compression/compaction (session metadata, not kernel state). Known residual limitation: client-placed `cache_control` breakpoints may still misalign after a head swap. Excluded from anchoring: title-gen micro-requests (OpenAI/Google), Responses compaction-trigger requests, auto-mode classifier requests. Clients implementing their own variant (stable prompt + in-history updates) get zero extra injection — such updates pass through as ordinary history. Default is OFF. `"stableSystemAnchor": true` in the config file does the same; the env var wins. |
| `BILI_ALLOW_DSH_COMPACTION` | Set `1` to let dsh's built-in auto-compaction run through bili (#2028). By default the wire-level guard (#1729) **refuses dsh native compaction calls locally** (403): dsh's `compaction-basic` answers context pressure by replaying the conversation prefix plus a fixed summarization directive as the final user message, and when such a call LANDS its checkpoint durably shadows the raw history — irreversible, and it destroys the proxy's compression substrate. This switch lifts the refusal so dsh-native compaction can actually execute. Scope note: on non-web profiles the shipped bundle patch (`auto: false`) still suppresses AUTO-triggering, so only manual `/compact` benefits there; on web profiles (where no patch layer reaches the preset-nested instance, #1772) auto-triggering works as-is once allowed. The web config page exposes the same switch; the env var wins over the file. `"allowDshCompaction": true` in the config file does the same. |
| `BILI_NO_CACHE_CONTROL` | Set `1` to disable bili's Anthropic-lane `cache_control` breakpoint stamping (#1637, shipped in #1639). On by default: Anthropic-style upstreams cache only what is explicitly breakpointed (max 4 per request, counted across system + tools + message blocks combined), so bili marks the system block plus up to 3 cumulative message marks — a marked message stays marked (byte-stable prefix), marks die only by folding, and the last 3 stable messages carry the advancing frontier. Any client-set `cache_control` (message blocks, tools entries) suppresses bili's stamps entirely — client-managed caching wins. Marks persist with the session. This switch is the escape hatch for upstreams that reject the field or relays with their own breakpoint policy. Plain-proxy Anthropic lane only; OpenAI/Responses lanes cache implicitly and are never stamped. Env-only; no config-file key. |
| `BILI_CHAIN_CONTENT` | Set `1` to turn ON the ACP-artifact / `<bili-chain …/>` checkpoint **body-content** detection of bili→bili chain awareness (#1086/#1421): when an inbound request carries compression artifacts (render tags / historical `acp_status`+`search_context` tool calls) or a digest-bearing checkpoint in its BODY but neither the `x-bili-hop` header nor local compression state for its session, bili records an advisory observation and/or applies first-processor-wins passthrough. **Default is OFF** (#1683 follow-up): by default ONLY the `x-bili-hop` header drives chain recognition, because scanning the request BODY can false-positive on CCR/file-introduced text and model-echoed tags that look like real markers. Enable it only for the narrow multi-bili relay case where an intermediate box strips `x-bili-hop` and you accept that false-positive risk. `"chainContentDetection": true` in the config file does the same; the env var wins. The `x-bili-hop` signal itself is unaffected by this switch. |
| `BILI_CHAIN_STAMP` | Set `1` to turn ON egress emission of the **model-visible** `<bili-chain …/>` chain-integrity checkpoint carrier (#1683, default OFF): when enabled, every request THIS instance actually processes leaves with a digest-bearing stamp so a downstream bili applies first-processor-wins even when the `x-bili-hop` header was stripped in transit (#1421). The carrier lands in a slot the terminal model also reads (a trailing `user` message on OpenAI/Responses, a trailing text part on Anthropic/Google), so models treat it as phantom user input and burn tokens commenting on it — which is why it is off by default. Enable it only for the narrow multi-bili relay case where `x-bili-hop` is stripped by an intermediate box and the digest-verified body-stamp is the sole guard against double-processing. Independent of `BILI_CHAIN_CONTENT` (inbound body-detection is also default OFF) and of the `x-bili-hop` passthrough, which works either way. `"chainEgressStamp": true` in the config file does the same; the env var wins. |
| `BILI_CHAIN_MAX_FUTURE_SKEW_MS` | Maximum future skew (ms) tolerated when validating a chain checkpoint's `issued-at` timestamp (#1395 step 2): a checkpoint stamped more than this far into the future is judged `stale` (replay / clock skew) even when its digest verifies. Default `120000` (2 min); non-numeric or non-positive values fall back to the default. Step 2 is shadow-only — these knobs tune verdict logging, never forwarding. |
| `BILI_CHAIN_RECENT_WINDOW_MS` | Recency window (ms) for chain-checkpoint validation (#1395 step 2): a checkpoint older than this is judged `stale`. Default `600000` (10 min); non-numeric or non-positive values fall back to the default. Step 2 is shadow-only — these knobs tune verdict logging, never forwarding. |
| `BILI_CONFLICT_SCAN` | Set `0` to disable third-party compression plugin detection (#1206). On by default: bili scans the client's own plugin/extension registries — opencode global + project `plugin` arrays, pi global + project `.pi/settings.json` `packages`, omp `config.yml` `extensions`, claude settings `enabledPlugins`/`plugins` + its plugins dir, kimi `plugins/installed.json`, hermes plugins dir, dsh profile dependencies — for another compressor co-resident with bili. Two tiers: **known conflicts** (`opencode-acp`, legacy `billion-context-pi`) and **keyword-suspected** entries (names matching compress / compact / acp / summar* / context*; bili's own entries are always skipped, and non-compression tools like `context7` do not match). Findings surface as launcher stderr lines before client start, a one-time proxy warn log on each session's first request, and the session's conflict ledger — visible in `acp_status`'s `COMPRESSION CONFLICTS` section, aggregated at `GET /__bili/stats` → `conflicts`, and shown as a web-UI banner. Runtime interference evidence (unannounced history rewrites #1001, orphan-block deactivations) feeds the same ledger. The scan is read-only, best-effort, 5-minute cached, and never blocks or modifies client config. |
| `BILI_UPSTREAM_PROXY` | Upstream proxy for the proxy's own outbound connections — highest priority among the *global* sources (above the Web UI manual proxy and the config-file `proxy`). A per-URL `providers.<url>.proxy` still wins for its matching provider URL. See [`proxy`](#server-settings) under Server Settings for the full resolution order, loop prevention, and examples. |
| `BILI_INHERITED_HTTP_PROXY` / `BILI_INHERITED_HTTPS_PROXY` / `BILI_INHERITED_ALL_PROXY` / `BILI_INHERITED_NO_PROXY` | Not user-facing — set automatically by the launcher when it spawns the proxy (#1012). The launcher strips the shell's proxy vars from both the client and the proxy child (clients must send to bili; the proxy must not have its model egress hijacked by a shell proxy), but it forwards the user's pre-strip proxy under these names so the proxy's **auxiliary egress** (MITM blind tunnels — client-side MCP/web traffic) can still ride the user's VPN. They feed only the blind-tunnel fallback tier: explicit routes / global `proxy` / `BILI_UPSTREAM_PROXY` / explicit `"upstreamProxyMode": "direct"` all still win, and a value pointing at bili's own port is dropped. Model egress is unaffected (stays direct unless explicitly configured). |
| `BILI_ATTACH_HEALTH_DEADLINE_MS` | Health-wait deadline (ms) for dsh/opencode attach verification when the attach target is down but this process's model channel is **pinned** to it (routed `/bili/…` model traffic was observed against it): bili waits for the target to come back instead of spawning a second instance — a spawn would split the session (model traffic stays pinned, bili tools would 404 against the other instance). When the deadline elapses it fails loudly and keeps re-checking on every model request until the target returns (default `15000`). See #1365. |
| `BILI_ATTACH_EVIDENCE_GRACE_MS` | Grace window (ms) during which a dsh/opencode attach verification probing a dead target waits for routed-channel evidence to appear before falling back to the legacy spawn path (covers the decision-before-first-request race: the probe fails at t≈0 while the first model request lands at t≈1s) (default `5000`). See #1365. |
| `BILI_PERSIST` | Set `0` to disable session persistence (in-memory only, lost on restart). |
| `BILI_PERSIST_DEBOUNCE_MS` | Debounce window for persistence writes to disk, in ms (default `500`). |
| `BILI_PERSIST_TAIL_TOKENS` | Token budget for the persisted conversation snapshot (#401). The disk record stores the **folded view** (block summaries in place of compressed ranges) truncated to the newest messages within this budget — never the raw full history. Default `16384`; `0` disables message persistence entirely (block summaries and compressed originals still persist; `bili export` falls back to block-only rendering). Live in-memory sessions are unaffected — `bili export` of a live session is always complete. |
| `BILI_PERSIST_ZSTD` | Set `1`/`true` to enable zstd compression of session files (#1080, owner decision: **default off** — plain JSON maximizes recoverability: jq/grep-debuggable, and immune to the downgrade tail risk). When enabled, every session file that actually shrinks is written as `BILIZSTD1` — a small header (magic + format version + mode byte) over the JSON body, zstd-compressed on Node ≥ 22.15 and stored raw on older runtimes; readers accept both bodies (native zstd, else the bundled WASM fallback), so files stay readable across runtimes and versions. Payloads the framing cannot shrink (tiny sessions) and key-less raw bodies stay bare JSON on disk. Independent of `BILI_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — with both active, the compression choice is recorded in the mode byte inside `BILIENC1`. Existing plain-JSON files are NEVER rewritten at boot (downgrade safety — a mass re-encode would make rolling back to an older bili read its own writes as "corrupt"); they convert organically on their next save. Note: once a session has been saved as `BILIZSTD1`, an OLDER bili (< 0.1.135) cannot read it — this caveat applies only to deployments that opted in; unset or any other value keeps plain JSON. |
| `BILI_PERSIST_EPERM_ALERT_THRESHOLD` | N consecutive persist write failures (`EPERM`/`EBUSY`/`EACCES`) on one session before the one-time "add this dir to antivirus exclusions" alert fires (default `5`). Windows only. See [Windows: exclude the sessions dir](#windows-exclude-the-sessions-dir-from-antivirus-362). |
| `BILI_PERSIST_EPERM_ALERT_REPEAT_MS` | Re-alert window for the persist EPERM alert, in ms. `0` (default) = alert once then stay silent; `>0` = re-alert at most every that many ms while the failures continue. |
| `BILI_TUNNEL_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `/bili/<absolute-url>` tunnel admission for **remote clients** (#409): comma-separated `host` or `host:port` entries that unlock loopback/private destinations (e.g. a LAN relay or the machine's own sglang) for non-loopback clients. The proxy itself and link-local/metadata addresses are always denied; local (loopback) clients always pass. |
| `BILI_MAX_SESSIONS` | Max sessions held in memory (default `256`; LRU eviction — disk is the source of truth). |
| `BILI_SESSIONS_DIR` | Directory for persisted session state (default XDG data dir). |
| `BILI_SESSION_GC` | Cleanup of stale session files (#1082) is **opt-in**: set to `1`/`true`/`on` to enable — off by default, because session files are user data (exportable, resumable) and there is no silent deletion policy. When enabled, the sweep (boot + hourly) deletes a file only when BOTH conditions hold: older than `BILI_SESSION_GC_MAX_AGE_DAYS`, AND small in the lossless sense — the session was **never compressed** (zero folded blocks) and its newest request body ≤ the token ceiling below, so resuming it costs one cold rebuild from the client's own history and nothing else. Safety rails: compressed sessions are NEVER deleted (their summaries cannot be rebuilt losslessly); a session still held in memory is skipped unless idle since its last disk write; unreadable/corrupt files are left in place; every deletion is audit-logged individually (path, size, age) plus one summary line per non-empty sweep; only the sessions dir is ever touched; emptied protocol subdirectories are removed. Note the resident guard is per-process: another proxy instance sharing `BILI_SESSIONS_DIR` that does not persist (e.g. `BILI_PERSIST=0`) never refreshes file mtimes, so its still-live session files can age out and be swept — the cost is the same bounded cold rebuild, backstopped by the age gate. CCR content stores (#1097) share the session's lifecycle (#1180): a `<hash>.content-store.json` companion is deleted together with its session file, an orphaned companion (session file already gone) is swept once past the age gate, and an unreadable companion keeps its session file too (never guessed at). |
| `BILI_SESSION_GC_MAX_AGE_DAYS` | Minimum age (days) before a session file becomes a GC candidate (default `7`). Keep it far beyond any plausible resume window: after deletion a resumed session restarts message numbering from m00001 while a resuming agent's transcript may still cite old numbers (kernel contract: ids are never reused). |
| `BILI_SESSION_GC_MAX_TOKENS` | Size ceiling (tokens) for GC eligibility (default `1000000` = 1M, owner-set in #1082). Judged against the **decoded** context, never file bytes (encrypted/zstd files are far smaller on disk): the token estimate of the newest request body (`rawInputTokens`, recorded per turn) wins when present; unrecorded legacy files use `stats.contextTokens`; and the companion content store's footprint (#1097: unique-content via the kernel's CJK-aware `defaultCountTokens`, same estimator as `rawInputTokens`, #1180) is added on top, so a small session carrying a huge store does not slip under the ceiling. Applies only to never-compressed sessions — files with folded blocks are always kept regardless of size, since their summaries cannot be rebuilt losslessly from a re-send. |
| `BILI_SESSION_GC_INTERVAL_MS` | Background GC sweep interval in ms (default `3600000` = 1h). A sweep also runs once at boot. |
| `BILI_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Encrypt session files at rest (#708) for deployments on untrusted nodes. Exactly 32 bytes, hex (64 chars) or base64; unset = unencrypted plain-JSON files (or `BILIZSTD1` when `BILI_PERSIST_ZSTD=1` — see `BILI_PERSIST_ZSTD`). When set: every session file is written as `BILIENC1` AES-256-GCM over JSON that is zstd-compressed only when `BILI_PERSIST_ZSTD=1` (zstd on Node ≥ 22.15, raw body otherwise) — enabling compression also shrinks the file ~5–10×. Encryption and compression are now independent knobs (#1080). The key comes ONLY from this environment variable — never written to disk or logs — so keep it out of the same filesystem's reach. Invalid values abort startup (fail fast, never silently unencrypted). Booting with the wrong key skips the affected sessions as corrupt (logged, no crash). Losing the key makes encrypted sessions permanently unreadable. Symmetric by design (the same process encrypts and decrypts). Existing unencoded files are never rewritten at boot — they encrypt organically on their next save (downgrade safety; see `BILI_PERSIST_ZSTD`). Threat model (#708, owner-confirmed): it defends against **offline/mechanical** file acquisition — provider disk swaps, offline disk snapshots after node-image drift, stolen volumes, leaked backups, cloud-synced state dirs — where an offline third party cannot read the content without the key. It does NOT defend against targeted adversaries with live access to the node; for that tier move the trust root out of the proxy (KMS / TEE / confidential VMs, hardened permissions) instead of solving it inside the proxy — at that level far more than the key is exposed, so proxy-level key handling is not the boundary to hold (`BILI_PERSIST=0` disables persistence entirely). Double-encrypting the key with a second key from the same process/environment adds nothing: in every offline-theft scenario the attacker lacks exactly one artifact — your off-disk secret — whether it is called the data key or the wrapping key; only a wrapping key in a different trust domain (KMS/TPM/TEE) raises the bar, and that is scenario 2 above. |
| `BILLION_CONTEXT_PROXY` | Exported by the launcher; client-side bili plugins/extensions detect it and self-disable their own compression (no double compression). |
| `BILLION_CONTEXT_PLUGIN` | Set `0` to disable plugin mode entirely (wire-level tool injection resumes). |
| `BILI_LAUNCHER_MODEL_WINDOWS` | Internal: the launcher hands the client's own per-model context windows (pi `models.json`, omp `models.yml`, opencode `models.<id>.limit`, codex `model_context_window`) to the spawned proxy as JSON, so the nudge denominator matches the real window for self-hosted models. Only the launcher sets it — no user configuration. |
 | `BILI_LAUNCHER_LANE` | Internal: the launcher hands its client's lane name (pi / codex / claude / …) to the spawned proxy, which records it in the instance file (#1225). Reuse is identity-based: two instances with *different declared* lanes never attach to each other; an instance without a declared lane is a manually-started user-zone daemon — attachable by default (#1660). Only the launcher sets it — no user configuration. |
| `BILI_LAUNCHER_PLUGIN` | Set `0` to disable the launcher's bili MCP server injection for claude/codex (pure wire mode); `1` forces plugin mode. Default: injected — except codex with a local/private upstream (sglang/vllm/ollama cannot parse codex's namespace tool type, so bili auto-falls back to wire tools there). See [Launcher Reference](#launcher-reference). |
 | `BILI_LAUNCHER_DIRECT` | Set `1` for direct-URL routing in the launcher (drop MITM/CA trust). See [Launcher Reference](#launcher-reference). |
 | `BILI_NATIVE_ATTACH_EXTERNAL` | Attach-gate escape hatch (#1335). Lane'd native hooks attach to a running proxy only when it reports an armed session-lifecycle watchdog (`watchdog.armed == true` in `/__bili/health`) — an unarmed *lane'd* proxy (a crashed session's orphan, or an instance whose lifecycle state cannot be verified) is refused loudly instead of being silently ridden. #1660: a **manually started `bili start` daemon** (no lane, no launch token) is user-zone by definition — native hooks attach to it by default, so a deliberate resident daemon “just works” without this env; you then own its lifetime and version. Set `1`/`true` to also attach to *lane'd* unarmed listeners anyway: any code/lane-compatible listener becomes attachable regardless of watchdog state (including pre-#1330 builds that report no `watchdog` field at all). `"native": { "attachExternal": true }` in the config file does the same; the env var wins (`0`/`false` closes the gate even over a permissive file — including for user-zone daemons, forcing fresh lane spawns). Default is closed (for lane'd instances). Full mechanics (reuse rules, listener table, escape hatch): [TECHNICAL-NOTES.md](TECHNICAL-NOTES.md#proxy-reuse-and-the-attach-gate-1225-1335-1232). |
 | `BILI_ZCODE_ROUTE` | zcode native-plugin routing scope (#1622): `all` (default — every provider entry with a usable http(s) baseURL rides compression, pi/dsh parity), `plans` (pre-#1622 bigmodel coding-plan whitelist), `none` (opt out; the bootstrap leaves the store direct). Compat escape hatch — there is **no** file equivalent; routing is on by default. |
 | `BILI_ZONE_PORT` | Base of the self-managed port zone (#1660, default `18787`): every *lane-spawned* proxy (claude/zcode native hooks, launcher lanes riding port 0) tries the lane's sticky record first, else this base; port collisions resolve via the child's +1 ladder — except when the holder is a same-lane predecessor running a different build (an upgrade-restart overlap), which the child waits out (up to 5s) and then rebinds the SAME port instead of drifting (#1723) — and the settled port is recorded sticky under `<state>/port-zone.json` so later launches follow drift automatically. Manual `bili start` keeps its own default (`8787`) — the user zone is never touched by lanes. |
 | `BILI_ZCODE_PORT` | Pin an **exact** port for the zcode native lane's proxy (#1660): the launch becomes strict-port — a squatter is refused loudly instead of hopping — and wrappers written into the shared store survive session restarts even without handoff. Without it the lane rides the self-managed zone (`BILI_ZONE_PORT` base + sticky drift following). |
 | `BILI_ZCODE_SIGNING_FIXED` | `1`/`true` = assume your ZCode build fixed ClientRequestSigningV4 (#1621): the per-entry skips for coding-plan accounts on v3.14+ personal stores flip off and they route again. Temporary escape hatch — there is **no** file equivalent. |
 | `BILI_CLAUDE_UPSTREAM` | claude direct mode: your relay endpoint, when `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` already points at a relay the launcher would otherwise bypass. |
 | `BILI_CLAUDE_NATIVE_PORT` | Pin an **exact** port for the claude native lane's hook-spawned proxy (#964/#1660): strict-port semantics — a squatter on the port is refused loudly instead of hopping — and the baked managed `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` points at it. Without it the hook rides the self-managed zone (`BILI_ZONE_PORT` base + per-lane sticky) and re-pins the managed URL to the live origin each session, so port drift self-heals (#1660). |
| `BILI_CODEX_COMPACT` | Codex native-compaction handling. Default `intercept`: bili intercepts codex's compaction requests and forges a local handoff to the ACP state when the safety gate passes (transform ok + steady-state usage < 90% of the window + at least one active compressed block) — trigger form forges a 2-frame SSE, endpoint form forges `{output}` — and never contacts upstream. Forged ACP summaries are re-injected as a history-borne handoff message (developer-message fallback) so compressed content stays visible after codex truncates its history. Set `pass` to opt out and forward codex's compaction requests upstream (native compaction backstops). On any gate failure the request passes through untouched. Codex client detection (which traffic this applies to, also used for window clamping and session-identity fingerprinting): the User-Agent must either start with a registered prefix (`codex_cli_rs/`, `codex_exec/`, `codex desktop/` — matched case-insensitively, since variants like Codex Desktop send an initial capital, #1169) or contain a whitespace-delimited component starting with lowercase `codex` (unknown variants such as `codex_sdk_ts/…`, #645 — narrowed from a bare substring to a token-level prefix in #1641 so non-codex clients whose UAs merely mention "codex" mid-token or in parens are no longer misclassified; the fallback stays case-sensitive on purpose so "Codex"-shaped relays are excluded, #1106). |

## Upstream Failure Diagnostics (proxied upstreams)

Every upstream transport failure is classified into a `kind=` that leads its log line (and the `error:` string clients/status see), each with a remediation hint (`hint=...`). The taxonomy (#1263):

| kind | meaning | bili behavior |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `client-abort` | downstream client disconnected | nothing (request dead by definition) |
| `upstream-timeout` | idle budget expired or connect timed out | **not retried** — never stack wait budgets |
| `proxy-reset` | connection died pre-response **through a proxy** (prime suspect: proxy idle-recycle / payload cap / node churn) | transparent replay, bounded by `BILI_REPLAY_RETRY_MAX` (default 3 total attempts) |
| `upstream-reset` | same, direct connection (suspect upstream/local network) | same (bounded by `BILI_REPLAY_RETRY_MAX`) |
| `connect-refused` | TCP refused (the proxy when configured, else upstream) | same (bounded by `BILI_REPLAY_RETRY_MAX`) |
| `dns` / `tls` / `unknown` | resolution / handshake / unclassified | not retried |

Handshake-class resilience is paired with a keep-alive cap for proxied connections (`BILI_PROXY_KEEPALIVE_MAX_MS`, default 55s) so bili stops offering proxies sockets they are about to recycle.

**Four-step checklist** when long sessions show periodic connection failures (from #1249):
1. Grep `bili.log` for `kind=` — `proxy-reset` clusters implicate the external proxy; `upstream-timeout` implicates upstream health.
2. Align timestamps of the failing requests with the external proxy's own access log (same host clock) — a recycle entry at the same millisecond closes the case.
3. Confirm which hop: `proxy=<url>` vs `proxy=direct` in the same line; check request body size (`content-length` of the forwarded request) against the proxy's documented payload cap.
4. If the proxy is the recycler, either raise its idle timeout or leave bili's 55s reuse cap + one-replay safety net to absorb it.

## CLI Reference

Full command surface (`bili --help` prints an abridged version). Precedence everywhere: **CLI flag > env var > config file > built-in default**.

## Client Integration

Two ways to point a client at the proxy without the launcher: the **`/bili/` prefix** (API-key clients) and **MITM transparent mode** (login clients with hardcoded endpoints).

### `/bili/` prefix (API-key clients)

Clients you configure with an **API key** (not a login) let you change the upstream URL. Prepend the proxy origin + `/bili/` to it — that's the only change. The API key stays in the client config and is passed through untouched.

**OpenCode** — edit `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, change the provider's `baseURL`:

```jsonc
// before:
"baseURL": "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/coding/paas/v4"
// after (prepend the proxy origin + /bili/):
"baseURL": "http://localhost:8787/bili/https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/coding/paas/v4"
```

**Codex (API key)** — edit `~/.codex/config.toml`, change the provider's `base_url`:

```toml
# before:
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
# after:
base_url = "http://localhost:8787/bili/https://api.openai.com/v1"
```

**Codex (ChatGPT login)** — set the top-level `openai_base_url` field (keeps `model_provider = "openai"` and OAuth login intact):

```toml
# ~/.codex/config.toml (top-level field, not a section)
model_provider = "openai"
openai_base_url = "http://localhost:8787/bili/https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex"
```

Run `codex login` as usual; the OAuth token travels in the `Authorization` header, which the proxy forwards untouched.

**Pi** — edit `~/.pi/agent/models.json`, change the provider's `baseUrl`:

```jsonc
// before:
"baseUrl": "https://api.anthropic.com"
// after:
"baseUrl": "http://localhost:8787/bili/https://api.anthropic.com"
```

**Claude Code** — set the `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` env var to the `/bili/` URL. (claude's undici fetch ignores `HTTPS_PROXY`, so the `/bili/` URL form is the only manual option — cert MITM cannot intercept it.)

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8787/bili/https://api.anthropic.com"
```

> **Auto-compact alignment (manual mode only).** The `bili claude` launcher automatically sets `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` to bili's effective window for your model, so claude's own auto-compact threshold lines up with bili's compression budget. In manual `/bili/` mode you must do this yourself — otherwise claude may run its own local auto-compact (a "summarize the conversation" turn) on a threshold that doesn't match bili's window. That is usually harmless (same session-id, so bili re-derives state from the truncation) but noisier than needed. Set it to bili's effective window for your model:
>
> ```bash
> export CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW=<bili effective window in tokens>
> ```
>
> claude clamps this value **down** to the window it perceives for the model (never up), so over-setting is safe. You can also set it persistently via claude's settings (`autoCompactWindow`).

**Other API-key clients** (Cursor / Aider / Continue …) — wherever the upstream URL is configured, prepend `http://localhost:8787/bili/`. Nothing else changes.

The `/bili/` prefix doubles as a **self-detection signal**: billion-context client extensions (billion-context-pi / opencode-acp) recognize it in their own baseUrl and self-disable, so you never get double compression.

### MITM transparent proxy (login clients)

Clients you sign **into an account** (ChatGPT Plus/Pro, Claude, ZCode coding plan, …) authenticate via OAuth and often **hardcode the endpoint** — if you can't change the baseURL, the prefix trick doesn't work. These use MITM mode instead.

How it works: the client only offers an **HTTP proxy** setting, so it sends `CONNECT <host>:443`; billion-context terminates the TLS locally (with a locally-generated root CA), injects compression into the cleartext, re-encrypts and forwards. The OAuth token travels in the client's `Authorization` header, which is forwarded untouched — so the subscription discount is preserved.

Supported MITM clients:

| Client | Login | Endpoint hardcoded | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ZCode** | bigmodel coding plan (OAuth) | `open.bigmodel.cn` (builtin provider) | ✅ tested |
| **Claude Code** | Claude subscription (OAuth) | `api.anthropic.com` | ❓ untested (may not work — needs verification) |
| **CodeBuddy** (VS Code IDE) | IDE account login | `copilot.tencent.com` (reached via `http.proxy`) | ✅ user-verified (#897) |

> **Codex exception:** Codex exposes a top-level `openai_base_url` config field, so the ChatGPT login version CAN use the `/bili/` prefix (see above). MITM is not needed for Codex.

> **ZCode native mode (#1145):** ZCode is the only client in this list that also has a **native plugin mode** — `bili plugin install zcode` routes model traffic through the provider store (`~/.zcode/v2/config.json`, or `provider_config.json` on v3.14+; on v3.14+ builds ZCode's client signing rejects the http loopback origin for the coding-plan accounts, so those stay direct with a logged reason while every other provider still routes — use the GUI cert-MITM setup for compression on those accounts, #1621) and needs no GUI proxy/CA setup at all otherwise. Native mode does not touch the MITM surface: if you run both, keep the GUI proxy settings (and the `"mitm://zcode.z.ai": { "passthrough": true }` route, #661) for login traffic. Full mechanics: [CLIENTS.md](CLIENTS.md) (*ZCode*).

MITM is scoped to a **whitelist** of model hosts (`open.bigmodel.cn`, `api.anthropic.com`, `api.openai.com`, `chatgpt.com`), plus per-lane stock-gateway defaults that discovery auto-seeds where a lane's config exists (e.g. `opencode.ai` — opencode's built-in zen gateway from `opencode auth login`, #1405). All other HTTPS hosts are blind-tunnelled — billion-context never decrypts non-model traffic.

> **CONNECT-only clients (`http.proxy`):** many IDE-class clients (CodeBuddy, Cursor, Windsurf, …) expose no model base-URL setting — they route all traffic through an HTTP proxy via `CONNECT`. Such a client is only decrypted when its model host is whitelisted above (or discovered/auto-whitelisted by a launcher); otherwise its tunnels are **blind**: no error, but also **no compression**, because billion-context never sees the cleartext. This misconfiguration is surfaced explicitly (#897): the first blind tunnel per host logs a one-time `BLIND TUNNEL WARNING` with the fix steps; `GET /__bili/health` and `/__bili/stats` report `blindTunnels` (count + exact target hosts, loopback-only); and `acp_status` gains an `UNDECRYPTED TRAFFIC (instance-level)` section while such tunnels exist. Fix: add the client's model domain to `"mitm".domains` (or `BILI_MITM_DOMAINS`), restart, and trust the root CA per the steps below. Note proxy logs mask non-public target hosts by default (`<private-host>`, #255) — set `BILI_LOG_MASK_HOSTS=0` to see them verbatim in your local log.

One-time setup (trust the root CA in the client):

1. Start the proxy once to generate the root CA:

   ```bash
   bili start
   ls ~/.local/share/billion-context/ca/root-ca.pem   # exists now
   ```

2. In the client's **Settings → Network / Proxy** set:
   - **HTTP Proxy**: `http://127.0.0.1:8787`
   - **Proxy CA certificate path**: the CA file bili actually generated on this machine — `~/.local/share/billion-context/ca/root-ca.pem` on Linux/macOS, `%USERPROFILE%\.local\share\billion-context\ca\root-ca.pem` on Windows. The ZCode card on the web UI's routing page shows the real path on this machine with a copy button — just paste it.
   - (optional) **No-proxy list**: `localhost,127.0.0.1`
   - (For ZCode specifically: **Settings → Network**. For Claude Code, set the `HTTPS_PROXY` env var and `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` to the CA path.)

   > **Windows note:** ZCode on Windows does **not** expand `~` — a `~/...` path is not found (independent of the current working directory). Enter the full absolute path, e.g. `C:\Users\<user>\.local\share\billion-context\ca\root-ca.pem` (#342).

3. Restart the client. Its model traffic now flows through billion-context with compression injected. Send a message and check the proxy log (`~/.local/state/billion-context/bili.log`) for `mitm <host>:443 tunnel established`.

> The root CA is generated locally and lives only on this machine; it is **not** a system-wide install. Only the client you configure (via its CA-path setting) trusts it, so no other app is affected. Deleting the CA files and restarting the proxy regenerates them.

To give a MITM login client its **own upstream proxy** (firewall/GFW) without affecting API-key clients on the same host, use the `mitm://` scheme key — see [MITM vs `/bili/` key schemes](#mitm-vs-bili-key-schemes).

---

## Launcher Reference

`bili <client>` brings up a proxy on an independent port (a **fresh instance every launch** — an already-running `bili start` is never reused, #216), then runs the client pointed at it. **No config-file edits**: the client's own config is **read** (never edited) to discover which upstream hosts it talks to; those hosts are auto-whitelisted for MITM so the proxy TLS-terminates exactly the hosts the client uses. When the client exits, a proxy the launcher started is stopped.

Both upstream schemes are covered automatically, with no config edits:

- **HTTPS upstreams → cert MITM.** The client is pointed at the proxy via `HTTPS_PROXY` and trusts the proxy's MITM root CA (`~/.local/share/billion-context/ca/root-ca.pem`, generated lazily). Compression is injected on the intercepted TLS stream.
- **HTTP / localhost upstreams → `/bili/` baseURL rewrite** (plaintext can't be MITM'd). The launcher rewrites the client's base URL through the client's own mechanism, via an isolated temp copy of its config — the real config files are never touched (details below).

How each client is pointed at the proxy (set automatically in the child env):

| Client | Redirect | CA trust |
|---|---|---|
| pi | `HTTPS_PROXY` + `BILI_PROVIDER_REWRITES` env manifest (extension `registerProvider`) | `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` |
| omp | `HTTPS_PROXY` + `BILI_PROVIDER_REWRITES` env manifest (extension `registerProvider`) | `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` |
| codex | `HTTPS_PROXY` + `-c key=value` overrides | `SSL_CERT_FILE` → `combined-ca.pem` |
| claude | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` = `/bili/` URL | none needed |
| opencode | `HTTPS_PROXY` + isolated `OPENCODE_CONFIG` | `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` |
| hermes | `HTTPS_PROXY` (plain-http rides absolute-form forward-proxy requests) | `SSL_CERT_FILE` → `combined-ca.pem` (+ legacy `HERMES_CA_BUNDLE` → `root-ca.pem`) |
| dsh | `HTTPS_PROXY` (+ `HTTP_PROXY` for plain-http) + `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`; **loopback-only** isolated `DSH_HOME` | `SSL_CERT_FILE` → `combined-ca.pem` |

`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` *appends* to the built-in trust store, so it points at the MITM root alone (`root-ca.pem`). `SSL_CERT_FILE` *replaces* the default CA bundle, so for codex/dsh/hermes it points at `combined-ca.pem` — a bundle containing the MITM root **plus** the OS trust store and the Node public roots. The OS-store merge matters because some launched clients treat this file as their *entire* trust pool (codex's rustls HTTP stack replaces rather than appends, #1807): any direct, non-proxied connection of theirs must validate against this file alone, so the file must be a superset of what the OS itself trusts (Windows cert stores via PowerShell, macOS keychains via `security(1)`; Linux already reads the filesystem bundle; rebuilt at most once per 24 h). Keeping pip/git/curl style TLS (blind-tunnelled, real certificates) working inside the child env is the original reason for the bundle (#152; hermes since #1375, because current hermes resolves ambient trust only through `SSL_CERT_FILE`; OS-store merge since #1807).

Claude Code's undici fetch ignores `HTTPS_PROXY`, so cert MITM cannot intercept it. Every claude upstream — including a pre-configured `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` relay — is routed through the `/bili/` URL form via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` instead; no CA trust is required.

Where upstreams are discovered from (read-only):

| Client | Read from |
|---|---|
| Pi | `~/.pi/agent/models.json` — each provider's `baseUrl` |
| omp | `~/.omp/agent/models.yml` — each provider's `baseUrl` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/config.toml` — each `[model_providers.<name>]` `base_url` (+ top-level `openai_base_url`) |
| Claude Code | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` env var, else hardcoded `api.anthropic.com` |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` — each provider's `baseURL` |
| hermes | `~/.hermes/config.yaml` — each provider's endpoint lines |
| dsh | `~/.dsh/settings.yaml` — every `baseURL`/`baseUrl`/`base_url` value, split by destination (loopback → `/bili/` rewrite; non-loopback https → MITM whitelist; non-loopback http → `HTTP_PROXY`); plus the built-in `deepseek-official` route via `$DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` |

### Generated files (what gets written — last resort only, #535)

The launcher prefers file-free injection (env vars > CLI flags/extension APIs > generated files; see TECHNICAL-NOTES.md, “Injection priority” section). Where a file is unavoidable it is a **copy** — the real config is never edited:

- **pi / omp** — nothing is written (#535): provider baseUrls ride the `BILI_PROVIDER_REWRITES` env manifest consumed by the bili extension at load (`registerProvider`), and auto native compaction is cancelled in-extension (`session_before_compact`; omp distinguishes auto vs manual via the `auto_compaction_start` announcement, #851) — but only on positive evidence the proxy actually carries the conversation (the plugin stamped `x-bili-plugin-conversation` for this session id, or omp's identity register succeeded, or `/__bili/plugin/status?conversationId=` confirms it); non-http(s) provider baseUrls (e.g. pi-claude-bridge's literal `"claude-bridge"`) are never cancelled by default, so their own compaction takeover keeps working (#1382); a provider can be opted in via its entry in the `providers` table — key = the provider id (a non-URL key is inert for routing), field `"compactionOptIn": true` — or `BILI_NON_HTTP_PROVIDERS` (env, comma-separated) — but opt-in only widens the candidate set, so even an opted-in provider is cancelled only on the same positive carriage evidence above (#1392) — manual `/compact` stays user-owned either way. The real `~/.pi` / `~/.omp` homes are untouched.
- **opencode** — a temp `opencode.json` pointed at by `OPENCODE_CONFIG` (removed when the client exits), with `/bili/`-rewritten plaintext baseURLs **plus the thin plugin appended** (`/acp` + `/acp-cache` commands). On OpenCode 1.x the `opencode-acp` entries are stripped from the clone (the host must not load it armed) and the thin plugin imports that same package as a library instead, gated on legacy sessions; the first stripped spec rides along via `BILI_OPENCODE_ACP_SPEC` so the bridge imports the exact copy the host would have loaded (#920). Relative local plugin specs (`./x`, `../x`) are re-anchored to absolute paths in the clone — opencode resolves them against the declaring config file's dir, which the clone no longer is (#826).
- **hermes** — nothing is written (#535): its httpx stack rides `HTTPS_PROXY` (+ `SSL_CERT_FILE` → `combined-ca.pem`; legacy `HERMES_CA_BUNDLE` stays set for older builds, #1375) — https via CONNECT cert-MITM, plain-http via absolute-form forward-proxy requests. If no providers are configured, the launcher prints a warning and hermes runs **unproxied** (compression off).
- **dsh** — split by destination (#535): dsh's fetch stack honors proxy envs except for an unconditional loopback bypass, so **non-loopback** upstreams ride `HTTPS_PROXY` (cert MITM) / `HTTP_PROXY` (absolute-form forward-proxy requests) with `SSL_CERT_FILE` → `combined-ca.pem`; only **loopback** upstreams keep the persistent overlay `DSH_HOME` (`~/.dsh-bili`) with a rewritten `settings.yaml` routing them through `/bili/`. `profiles/`, credentials and sessions are symlinked through; the real `~/.dsh` is never touched. Home-root SQLite databases are the one exception to sharing: each launch gets a private copy in the overlay, merged back as a unit on exit (a file-linked main db would let the two paths grow independent WALs over one inode — #1917). The built-in `deepseek-official` route is captured separately via `$DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` (dsh resolves `settings llm-deepseek.baseURL` ?? env ?? default, so a user setting wins and the env is the zero-config fallback) — with no custom providers the deepseek route is still proxied out of the box.
- **codex** — a persistent overlay `CODEX_HOME` (`~/.codex-bili`, or `<CODEX_HOME>-bili`) whose other entries (auth, sessions, model settings) stay shared links into the real home. The exception is home-root SQLite databases (`*.db` / `*.sqlite` / `*.sqlite3` — codex keeps its logs/state there): each launch gets a private copy in the overlay, merged back into the real home as ONE unit on exit (newer main-db generation wins; the loser is preserved as `<name>.bili-conflict`). File-linking those dbs across the two homes lets two paths grow independent WALs over one inode — committed writes lost or the database corrupted (#1917). Two generated files: (a) when MCP injection is on, a merged `config.toml` — real contents plus the per-spawn `[mcp_servers.bili]` block (inline `-c` values cannot survive cmd.exe quoting on Windows, #681); (b) since #1802, a generated `.env` (mode 0600) that re-pins THIS launch's `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` / `SSL_CERT_FILE` / `BILLION_CONTEXT_PROXY`: codex's own `load_dotenv()` overwrites the launcher's spawn env from `$CODEX_HOME/.env` **after** start, so a user `.env` pointing at e.g. a socks5h proxy would otherwise silently re-route codex off bili (and codex's custom-CA rustls HTTP stack cannot speak SOCKS at all). Your other `.env` variables are carried over verbatim; pre-existing shared `.env` links are migrated to an owned file; the real home's `.env` and every other real-home file are never touched. Direct-URL mode (`BILI_LAUNCHER_DIRECT=1`) generates no `.env` (there is no injected proxy to protect) and, without MCP, no overlay at all.

### Native tools in the launcher

- **pi** — if the plugin is NOT installed, the launcher rides pi's `-e <file>` flag to load `dist/agent/pi.js` for that run only (nothing is written): native tools + the `/acp`, `/acp-cache` and `/acp-rule` commands out of the box (`/acp-cache` defaults to the summary ledger — totals, verdicts, anomalies; append `full` (or `--full`) for the every-line listing, same as passing `detail: "full"` to the `acp_cache` tool). If it IS installed, the symlinked `settings.json` already loads it — no `-e` is added.
- **omp** — does NOT ship the plugin; the launcher auto-injects `-e dist/agent/omp.js` when the config carries no loadable bili entry (same zero-config ride as pi). Two omp-specific mechanics make the plugin fully native there: omp 17.x mounts extension tools that omit `loadMode` under its `xd://` device URLs (invisible to the model's main turn), so the plugin registers its tools with `loadMode: "essential"` — the model gets the four ACP tools natively; and since omp's fork emits no `before_provider_headers`, the plugin binds the conversation via the launcher identity register (`POST /__bili/plugin/register`, keyed by omp's session id = `prompt_cache_key`/`x-session-id`) — bound sessions run in plugin mode (wire injection suppressed) with the native `/acp`, `/acp-cache` and `/acp-rule` commands.
- **opencode** — the temp config appends the thin plugin automatically.
- **claude / codex** — on by default: the launcher injects a single `bili` MCP server (an ephemeral `--mcp-config` file for claude; for codex the definition lives in the overlay's generated `config.toml`, see [Generated files](#generated-files-what-gets-written---last-resort-only--535) — nothing written to the real host config either way), so the host gets native tools out of the box (verified with claude 2.1.227 / codex 0.147.0). `BILI_LAUNCHER_PLUGIN=0` falls back to plain wire mode — for hosts older than the verified builds that have not been tested against the injection flags.
- **codex + self-hosted upstream auto-fallback** — codex 0.147 ships MCP tools to the model as a `namespace` tool type; self-hosted servers (sglang/vllm/ollama/llama.cpp) do not parse it, leaving the tools silently invisible. When the codex upstream host is loopback/private (`127.0.0.1`, RFC1918, ULA, `.local`, …) and `BILI_LAUNCHER_PLUGIN` is unset, bili automatically uses wire mode instead (flat tools every server understands) and says so on stderr. `BILI_LAUNCHER_PLUGIN=1` forces plugin mode regardless.
- **hermes** — no plugin API; always wire mode.
- **dsh** — the launcher always splices a `--patch <file>` flag into dsh's argv (written to `~/.dsh-bili/.bili-acp.patch.yml`), inserting `dist/agent/dsh-acp.js` into the profile's loader tree: the native `/acp` and `/acp-cache` commands, same shape as dsh's own `/compact` (`/acp-cache` shows the default summary ledger — dsh's command API passes no arguments, so there is no `full`). Works on every profile that composes the commands service (web/tui interactive surfaces; the `headless` one-shot driver sends its task straight to the model and parses no commands — `/compact` behaves the same there). Subcommand forms are handled: `dsh web` gets the flag after `web`, `dsh plugin`/`--dump-default-config` take none.

Launcher-mode matrix:

| Mode | Tools surface | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| Launcher + MCP (default for claude/codex) | native MCP tools | none — just `bili claude` / `bili codex` |
| Launcher wire mode (claude/codex, `BILI_LAUNCHER_PLUGIN=0`) | proxy-injected wire tools | one env var |
| Launcher `-e` / auto-plugin (pi, opencode; omp built-in) | native plugin tools | none |
| Manual plugin (`bili plugin install`) | agent-side plugin | run install |
| Manual baseURL (`/bili/` prefix) | proxy-injected wire tools | edit client config |

### Direct-URL mode (opt-in)

`BILI_LAUNCHER_DIRECT=1` drops MITM/CA trust entirely — claude's `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` / codex's provider `base_url` point at the `/bili/` prefix directly. Warnings:

- **codex direct mode**: the LLM traffic does **not** go through the proxy, so compression is not applied — only the bili MCP tool calls do. For full compression use the default MITM mode (unset `BILI_LAUNCHER_DIRECT`).
- **claude direct mode**: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is overridden to the proxy; a pre-configured relay is bypassed unless `BILI_CLAUDE_UPSTREAM=<relay>` is set. OAuth-subscription traffic requires the default MITM mode.

`--mitm-domain <domain>` (repeatable) adds extra domains to the MITM whitelist beyond what auto-discovery finds — useful for hosts the client fetches at runtime rather than from its config file. The launcher picks a free port automatically if the default is taken; `--passthrough` / `--debug` / `--no-auto-update` work like plain `bili`.

---

## Plugin Mode (native tools)

For a native-plugin experience, an agent can run a small cooperative plugin alongside the proxy: the plugin registers the four ACP tools (`compress` / `decompress` / `search_context` / `acp_status`) natively with the agent and drives the agent's own tool loop, while the proxy stays the compression authority (state, history folding, philosophy prompt, nudges). Tool schemas are served by the proxy itself (`GET /__bili/plugin/manifest`), so plugin and proxy can never drift. Protocol spec: [PLUGIN.md](PLUGIN.md).

Plugin-equipped sessions are detected automatically via request headers — wire-level tool injection is then suppressed for them (no double compression, native tool UX). Works in both proxy modes: the `/bili/` prefix baseURL **and** MITM transparent mode. The plugin can also report the agent's own model context window (`x-bili-plugin-context-window`) and read live context usage via `GET /__bili/plugin/status`. One header goes the other way: `x-bili-plugin-bypass: 1` makes the proxy raw-passthrough the request ahead of any pipeline processing (no session binding, injection, or compression) — stamped by the opencode bridge for legacy acp sessions whose compression runs in-process (#920).

### install / remove / list

```bash
bili plugin install pi      # add this billion-context install to pi's settings.json (packages)
                                  # npm installs write the pi-managed npm: spec; dev checkouts keep the abs path
bili plugin install omp     # same for omp (config.yml extensions)
bili plugin install claude  # register the bili MCP server (claude mcp add, user scope) + write
                                   # <configdir>/commands/acp-cache.md (model-mediated /acp-cache)
bili plugin install codex   # append [mcp_servers.bili] to ~/.codex/config.toml
bili plugin install opencode  # self-spawning native plugin (+ tools) in ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json
                                  # --with-mcp also adds the mcp.bili MCP face (no origin pin — live discovery)
bili plugin list            # install status for every supported host
bili plugin remove pi       # undo (original files backed up to *.bili-bak once)
```

`install pi` also replaces any **legacy** billion-context entries (old `npm:billion-context-pi` references, stale `npm:billion-context@x.y.z`, leftover dev-checkout paths) so exactly one bili plugin stays live; when it drops entries the output also reminds you that a **project-scope** entry (`pi install -l`, written to `<project>/.pi/settings.json`) is outside this global settings and must be removed by hand. With an npm-installed bili the written entry is the pi-managed spec `npm:billion-context` — pi installs it into `~/.pi/agent/npm/` automatically (also on startup if missing) and `pi update` upgrades it, so the entry survives node prefix moves across machines; a dev/checkout install keeps the machine-local abs path (pi loads local package dirs directly). Both load the `pi` manifest → `dist/agent/pi-native.js`, the self-spawning native entry — bare `pi` gets full plugin-mode compression with no launcher (#519).

**Coexistence with the standalone `billion-context-pi` extension.** The two are mutually exclusive — both active means double compression. Three nets: the installer strip above (global settings), the `BILLION_CONTEXT_NATIVE=pi` marker the native entry sets synchronously at load (`billion-context-pi` **0.1.72+** re-reads it on every event and refuses; 0.1.71 and older check `BILLION_CONTEXT_PROXY` only at load time, before the native proxy exists), and a runtime scan: once its proxy is up, the pi-native entry reads both pi settings files and warns loudly about any co-resident legacy entry the installer never saw (project scope, or installed after the fact).

The installed plugin is a **thin** one (~5 KB, zero runtime deps): it detects the proxy (from the `/bili/` baseURL or `BILLION_CONTEXT_PROXY`), fetches tool schemas from the proxy, registers native tools, and forwards executions — the proxy remains the single compression authority, so plugin and proxy always match versions. Hosts without a plugin API (claude, codex) install the MCP bridge (`dist/mcp.js`) instead — same protocol underneath, though MCP has no slash-commands (no `/acp` panel command; claude additionally gets a model-mediated `/acp-cache` markdown command written to `<configdir>/commands/acp-cache.md`, whose prompt drives the `acp_cache` MCP tool — the model pastes the report back verbatim). opencode has its own plugin API, so its install adds the native plugin tools and no MCP face by default (`--with-mcp` opts in; the entry carries no `BILI_MCP_PROXY` pin — `dist/mcp.js` discovers the live proxy via the instance file at call time, which survives the native plugin's ephemeral-port restarts, #926).

Kill switch: `BILLION_CONTEXT_PLUGIN=0` disables plugin mode entirely (wire-level injection resumes).

**When do you need `plugin install` at all?** Launcher users mostly don't (see [Launcher Reference](#launcher-reference) — pi/omp get `-e` auto-injected, opencode auto-injects, claude/codex get the MCP server auto-injected, dsh gets the native `/acp` and `/acp-cache` commands via `--patch`, hermes is wire-only). It's for a manually-configured client (`/bili/` prefix or MITM) where you want the native panel: pi/omp/opencode get native tools + `/acp` and `/acp-cache` (pi/omp additionally get `/acp-rule`; on omp the fork hides extension tools from the model — the plugin's value there is those commands); claude/codex get native MCP tools (no `/acp`; claude gets the model-mediated `/acp-cache` markdown command); dsh gets `/acp` and `/acp-cache` through the launcher's `--patch` (a manually-configured dsh can add the same patch itself); hermes can't (wire only). Without any plugin everything still works — compression runs via wire-injected tools, and the model can be asked to call `acp_status` to check live usage.

### Detecting other compression plugins (#1206)

Two compressors on one conversation double-compress and corrupt message refs, so bili actively looks for other compressors co-resident with itself:

- **Scan** (read-only, best-effort, 5-minute cache): opencode global + project config `plugin` arrays; pi global + project `.pi/settings.json` `packages`; omp `config.yml` `extensions`; claude settings `enabledPlugins`/`plugins` keys + `~/.claude/plugins/` dir; kimi `plugins/installed.json`; hermes `~/.hermes/plugins/` dir; dsh profile `package.json` dependencies. Two tiers: **known conflicts** (`opencode-acp`, legacy `billion-context-pi` — deterministic) and **keyword-suspected** entries (names matching compress / compact / acp / summar* / context*; bili's own entries are always skipped, non-compression tools like `context7` do not match).
- **Where findings surface:** launcher stderr before the client starts; a proxy warn log on each session's first request (client identified from the `x-bili-plugin` header or wire headers); and the session's conflict ledger — `acp_status`'s `COMPRESSION CONFLICTS` section, `GET /__bili/stats` → `conflicts`, web-UI banner.
- **Runtime evidence:** unannounced history rewrites (#1001) and orphan-gc deactivations (summarized content deleted out of the client's history) are recorded in the same ledger, so *suspected* coexistence and *observed* interference cross-check each other.
- Under the opencode launcher/native mode a present `opencode-acp` is info-only by design (#920 absorbs it for legacy sessions); everywhere else it warns.
- Disable: `BILI_CONFLICT_SCAN=0`.

## Sessions & Migration

### Compression state lives in the proxy (#151)

Compression state (blocks, summaries, original message cache) lives **in the proxy**, not in the client. The client's own local history is the full uncompressed view. Two consequences:

- If you point the client back at the real upstream (or stop the proxy), the client replays its **full local history** every turn. After a long compressed session this can exceed the model's context window (`context_window_exceeded`).
- There is no way to "unpack" a compression block into the client's local history — the client never saw the compressed form.

### Storage lifecycle at boot (#401)

The proxy boots session storage with a **single** directory walk+parse (load and the one-time #286 identity migration run over the same parsed map). Sessions are kept permanently — the design goal is that a year-long conversation is never lost — so there is no retention or size-budget pruning. The #286 migration writes a `.bili-migration-286.done` marker after its first pass, so it never re-scans or re-logs on later boots.

### Migrating off the proxy

Export the session and paste it into a fresh conversation as a handoff:

```bash
bili export                      # list persisted sessions (id, label, blocks)
bili export <id|label>           # print a Markdown handoff (block summaries)
bili export <id> --full          # include the original messages per block
bili export <id> --full --output handoff.md
```

Then start a new conversation in the client (direct to upstream) and paste the handoff doc as the opening context.

### Codex subagents get their own compression namespace (#150)

Codex subagents (e.g. the `guardian_subagent` approval reviewer) reuse the main conversation's `session_id`, so on the wire they look like the same session. Without care their requests inherit the main conversation's compression state — a subagent turn can get its context folded (losing the verbatim user authorization it must read back) and the two roles' usage estimates pollute each other.

billion-context detects this via the `instructions` field: subagent requests carry their own role prompt. The **first** instructions seen for a conversation anchor the main namespace (stable even if the main prompt drifts); any other instructions value maps to a separate `|sub:` namespace with its own empty compression state. Subagent requests are self-contained replays, so the fresh namespace is lossless — and the web UI's session list shows the two namespaces as separate sessions sharing the same client label.

### Windows: exclude the sessions dir from antivirus (#362)

billion-context persists each session's compression state to one JSON file per session under the sessions dir (`%USERPROFILE%\.local\share\billion-context\` by default) and rewrites that file on every turn of a long session. On Windows, real-time antivirus (Windows Defender), the search indexer, or a sync tool (OneDrive) can lock that directory mid-write. When the lock holds across several writes, the rename fails with `EPERM` and every persist for that session fails until the lock is cleared.

When the same session fails N consecutive writes (default `5`, tunable via `BILI_PERSIST_EPERM_ALERT_THRESHOLD`), the proxy logs a **one-time, actionable alert** naming the exact directory to exclude. It does not repeat (set `BILI_PERSIST_EPERM_ALERT_REPEAT_MS > 0` to re-alert at most every M minutes while the failures continue).

To stop the failures at the root, add the sessions dir to your antivirus exclusions and keep it out of any sync folder:

1. **Windows Defender exclusions:** Settings → Privacy & security → Windows Security → Virus & threat protection → Manage settings → **Exclusions** → **Add an exclusion** → *Folder* → select `%USERPROFILE%\.local\share\billion-context\`.
2. **Do not sync this directory.** Make sure OneDrive (or Dropbox / Google Drive / similar) is not syncing `%USERPROFILE%\.local\share\billion-context\`. If it lives under a synced folder, relocate it with `BILI_SESSIONS_DIR` to a non-synced path.

High-frequency persist writes otherwise re-trigger the real-time scan on every turn — which is what produces the `EPERM` write failures. Once the directory is excluded, the alerts stop.
