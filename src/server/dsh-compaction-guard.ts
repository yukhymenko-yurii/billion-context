/**
 * #1729: dsh native compaction-call guard.
 *
 * dsh's `dsh-compaction-basic` answers context pressure by replaying the whole
 * conversation prefix and appending a fixed summarization directive
 * (COMPACTION_INSTRUCTION, dsh-compaction-basic/lib/index.js) as the FINAL
 * user message, reusing the same session id so the provider's KV prefix cache
 * stays warm. In the desktop lane those calls ride bili under the main
 * conversation id — the second producer of #1729's deadlock — and when one
 * LANDS, dsh durably shadows the replayed surface range: the original
 * messages never ride a future request again, which destroys the proxy's
 * compression substrate (irreversible, unlike every cost of refusing).
 *
 * This guard identifies the call at the traffic level and refuses it locally:
 * never forwarded, kernel state untouched. Two-signal AND, per the
 * claudeSubagentSplit (#970) discipline — both signals must agree, and the
 * failure direction is "stop intercepting" (a reworded template degrades to
 * today's behavior; a normal turn can never match: multi-turn requests carry
 * far more messages than DSH_COMPACTION_MAX_MESSAGES):
 *   1. MARKER — the final user message STARTS with the versioned instruction
 *      prefix (machine-appended by the summarizer, never user-chosen);
 *   2. SHAPE — the whole request is ≤ DSH_COMPACTION_MAX_MESSAGES messages
 *      (replayed prefix collapsed + directive; observed live: 2 msgs at
 *      ~152K tokens in the #1729/#1727 logs).
 *
 * Deliberately unconditional (auto pressure, context-overflow recovery, and
 * manual /compact all send the same envelope — the traffic layer cannot tell
 * which trigger fired, and a landed checkpoint is equally destructive from
 * any of them). Not gated on the dsh plugin marker: a dsh host routed through
 * a global bili proxy without the plugin bundle must be covered too. Refusal
 * message text intentionally rides into dsh's own warn line
 * ("step compaction failed: <message>; continuing the turn").
