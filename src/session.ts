 * reading (armFailureShrink window feeding effectiveTokenCount's #1492

 * usage then settles within one interval of the low baseline, the kernel never
 * self-resets and every later growth calculation runs against the phantom —
 * permanently negative, blocking the tier cadence until context regrows past
 * the phantom level or a compression resets the references.
 *
 * Called from every usage-grade settle site (plugin SSE pipes via
 * applyUsageSample, proxy streaming loops via recordUsage, non-streaming JSON)
 * AFTER lastInputTokens has been written from the real report. Fires only for
 * drops of more than one full growth interval below the current reference
 * (lastNudgeShownTokens, else baseline) — estimates never trigger it. On fire
 * it mirrors the kernel's drift-reset trio: baseline := real value,
 * lastNudgeShownTokens := 0, lastShownByTier := {} — so the next prepare
 * measures growth from reality with a full interval of cadence headroom. */
